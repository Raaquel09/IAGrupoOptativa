<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Learning in living organisms is typically associated with networks of neurons. The use of large numbers of adjustable units has also been a crucial factor in the continued success of artificial neural networks. In light of the complexity of both living and artificial neural networks, it is surprising to see that very simple organisms -even unicellular organisms that do not possess a nervous system -are capable of certain forms of learning. Since in these cases learning may be implemented with much simpler structures than neural networks, it is natural to ask how simple the building blocks required for basic forms of learning may be. The purpose of this study is to discuss the simplest dynamical systems that model a fundamental form of non-associative learning, habituation, and to elucidate technical implementations of such systems, which may be used to implement non-associative learning in neuromorphic computing and related applications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A fascinating aspect of all living systems is their capacity to learn. One of the most basic forms of non-associative learning is habituation, which is characterized by a progressively diminishing response to repetitive stimulation. This ability allows organisms, which are typically immersed in rich environments filled with benign, repeti-tive stimuli, to "tune out" neutral signals and thus preserve limited cognitive resources and energy for responding to more salient ones (e.g. potential predators, prey, and mates). Despite its prevalence, dynamical mechanisms underlying habituation remain poorly understood.</p><p>Although habituation is classically associated with animal (i.e. neuronal) learning, it has been observed across different kingdoms of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Thus, nervous systems are not a necessary ingredient for this fundamental form of learning. Remarkably, it has also been reported in various unicellular organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and in certain nonliving systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>. In the latter works, which report the first technical implementations of habituation to the authors' knowledge, habituation of material conductance is mediated by repeated exposure to hydrogen gas, which transiently alters the electronic properties of the material (perovskite nickelate SmNiO 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> or the Mott insulator nickel oxide <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>).</p><p>Artificial implementations of non-associative learning are of practical interest because of their potential use in neuromorphic computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> and generalized physical learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. In particular, Zuo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> showed that a habituation-inspired extension of spiking artificial neural networks (ANNs) mitigates the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting and outperforms the standard ANN in pattern recognition. Similarly, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> demonstrated an artificial network inspired by non-associative learning has advantages for unsupervised clustering.</p><p>In the present paper, we present a simple analog circuit that implements hallmarks of non-associative learning, which essentially resulted from the authors' effort to find the simplest possible dynamical systems for habituation. Due to its simplicity, this circuit may ultimately help improve analog implementations of artificial learning sys-tems, which are of interest, among other reasons, because they help close the gap in energy efficiency between living learning systems and their artificial counterparts (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>).</p><p>Non-associative learning is typically understood to comprise both habituation and sensitization, the progressive attenuation and amplification of a response to a repeated stimulus, respectively. We focus on habituation because it is the more complicated of the two processes (as will be obvious from the proposed circuit). A seminal review by <ref type="bibr">Thompson and Spencer [17]</ref> outlined nine characteristic features associated with habituation in living systems. These features have since been revisited and refined <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and are commonly known as the "hallmarks of habituation". A starting point for our work is to restate these observational hallmarks in a mathematical setting (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). It is evident from their original statements that not all hallmarks need apply in order for an organism to be understood to habituate (cf. the "may" in H 6 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, for example). In line with the common interpretation of the hallmarks, we consider the first sentence of hallmarks H 1 and H 2 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) to be necessary conditions.</p><p>We pose the question of how simple a habituating dynamic system may be and answer this question from a systems &amp; control perspective. In the systems biology literature, this question would be paraphrased to read What does a motif for habituation look like? (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for a classical text on motifs and their nonlinear dynamics).</p><p>An electrical circuit that mimics habituation in living systems was given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. There, the circuit was linear, however, and a nonlinear post-processing of the signals generated by the circuit was required. The circuit proposed here generates the habituating response by itself and we show any circuit capable of this must be nonlinear.</p><p>We present the proposed circuit and a corresponding dynamical system that respect hallmarks H 1 and H 2 in Section 2, and show how the circuit can be extended to account for additional hallmarks. It will be evident that the circuit and system, due to their simplicity, are not amenable to further simplifications. We prove that the nonlinearity of the circuit cannot be removed in Section 3. Conclusions and an outlook are stated in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notation and Preliminaries</head><p>All systems are single-input-single-output systems unless stated otherwise.</p><p>Biological systems and their signals are bounded. In cellular signaling cascades, for example, signals are coded as concentrations of biochemical species, which implies they are bounded from below because concentrations are nonnegative. Similarly, membrane potentials of nerve cells cannot exceed lower and upper bounds in living organisms. We assume without restriction that signals are bounded from below by zero. Furthermore, we assume without restriction the origin is a steady state that results in a zero output signal.</p><p>We model periodic input stimuli by rectangular functions with an amplitude A, period T , and duty d. We abbreviate u(kT ) by u[k] where convenient. Let y[k] denote the largest output that results in period k, i.e., y[k] = max{y(t)|t â [kT, (k + 1)T )}, which always exists for the systems considered here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PROPOSED SYSTEM AND CIRCUIT</head><p>The proposed circuit and two useful extensions are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Modeling this circuit is straightforward but results in a differential-algebraic model with an output that cannot be stated in explicit form due to the diode. The resulting model is stated in Section 2.1. We derive a simplified model in Section 2.2 that is still nonlinear but in explicit input-output form. It is shown in Section 2.3 that the proposed circuit habituates.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The proposed circuit and system habituate</head><p>We first illustrate the approximation (2) of the diode equation (1c) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> for completeness.

The RC circuit subsystem integrates the rectangular stimuli from its initial condition x(0) = 0 until a forced limit cycle is reached for x(t) (green curve in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The first order lag implemented by the RC circuit and its state x essentially implement a memory variable that, roughly speaking, counts sufficiently fast stimuli (e.g. green curve for 0 â¤ T â¤ 15T in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) and forgets these stimuli over time (e.g. green curve for 16T â¤ t â¤ 30T in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>The output essentially subtracts the memory variable</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ð¦(ð¡) ð¥(ð¡) R 1 C R 2 D (a) ð¢(ð¡) R 1 C R 2 D (c) R 3 R 1 C R 2 R 4 D (b) ð  Figure 1: (a)</formula><p>Proposed circuit with input u(t) and output y(t) = U R 2 , the voltage across R 2 .

This extension is expected to be useful in future analyses of series and parallel connections of (a); analogous generalizations have been used before to cover additional hallmarks (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>). (c) Extension by a path that discharges C for s = 1. The additional signal s(t) is used to implement sensitization control for hallmark H 8 in Section 2.3.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). As explained in the text, the RC subcircuit implements a leaky memory x(t) of recent inputs u(t) to the system, which is then compared with the input signal to generate the response y(t). Notation: u(t) denotes the input voltage, x(t) denotes the voltage across the capacitor, and y(t) denotes the voltage across resistor R 2 (all in V). The third plot shows the (scaled) argument of the nonlinearity in (3b) as a dashed line.</p><p>from the input signal (up to scaling with a and c and a constant shift b), which is evident from the circuit and the argument cuâx+b of the ReLU in (3b). Due to the diode, negative voltages across R 4 are not passed to the output, which is again evident from the ReLU in (3b) and I D &gt; 0 in the diode equation in (1c).</p><p>As a result of these two operations, subtraction and rectification, the output y(t) shows the desired behavior for hallmark H 1 in response to periodic stimuli (blue curve in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, up to t = 15T ). When the stimuli pause (blue curve, 16T â¤ t &lt; 30T ), the circuit forgets about the earlier stimuli (x(t) approaches zero around t = 30T ). The first subsequent stimulus (t = 30T ) results in the same response as the stimulus at t = 0, which implies the circuit recovered spontaneously, i.e. it respects hallmark H 2 .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows that the system respects hallmark H 6 for wait 14T + 5T wait 14T</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>: The proposed circuit and system fulfill hallmark H 6 , subliminal accumulation, if the components are chosen to achieve an asymptotic value zero for y(t) when subjected to periodic stimuli. Solid curves (u 1 , x 1 , y 1 ): Stimulation with a comb of length 4 is sufficient to approach the asymptotic output value y = 0. The system requires a delay of 14 periods after the first comb ends to recover nearly fully when stimulated again at t = 15T . Dashed curves (u 2 , x 2 , y 2 ): When stimulated with a longer first comb, the memory variable x(t) can reach higher values. As a result, the system recovers later, about 19 periods after the first comb ends. In both simulations (solid and dashed), the first combs are aligned to stop at t = 0 to facilitate comparison. Distinct parameters for these simulations relative to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">3 are R 1 = 1 kâ¦, R 3 = 18 kâ¦, R 4 = 2 kâ¦.</formula><p>some values of its components. These values are altered for the simulations shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> for better visibility of the desired effect. We claim without giving details that all behaviors shown in all figures are robust with respect to the component values, i.e. they do not appear for singular choices of the components. In the case shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, after four stimulations the system reaches an asymptotic output value of y = 0 (which it cannot exceed due to the ReLU-like nonlinearity of the diode). If the system continues to be stimulated after reaching this asymptotic response (dashed curves in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>), it exhibits subliminal accumulation (hallmark H 6 ). Prior to the second round of stimulation, this effect is not directly visible from the response y alone (hence subliminal as in the original biological literature). The effect is transparent if one has access to the memory variable x(t): the overstimulated system requires a longer duration to recover fully (20T instead of 15T ) due to the accumulation of x 2 relative to x 1 . This effect can be made more or less pronounced (or even removed) depending on the parameters of the circuit elements.</p><p>Finally, Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that s(t) introduced in Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref> achieves sensitization (or equivalently, dishabituation to use the terminology of hallmark H 8 ). Closing the switch at time t = 10T results in discharging the capacitor to U C = x = 0, which is equivalent to resetting the RC circuit to its initial discharged state or forcing the memory variable to forget all earlier stimuli. In the simulation shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the switch had a resistance of 47â¦ in its closed state which gives rise to an exponential discharge curve for t â [10T, 11T ) in the figure. </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">R 1 = 470 â¦ R 2 = 10 kâ¦ R 3 = 8.2 kâ¦ R 4 = 2.2 kâ¦ I S = 1 â¢ 10 â15 A n = 1 U T =</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">LTI SYSTEMS DO NOT HABITUATE</head><p>It is instructive to consider if the proposed circuit and system can be simplified further. Since the diode D is the only nonlinear component in the proposed circuit, it is natural to ask whether the diode can be omitted, or more generally, whether there exists a linear system that habituates.</p><p>We show linear time-invariant systems cannot habituate in this section. We use a behavioral setting and notation (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>) in order to not restrict the result to ordinary differential equations or their discrete-time counterparts.</p><p>While the claim and proof stated in Proposition 3.1 are a bit technical due to their intended generality, the essential idea is simple and sketched in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>: Assuming a system habituates in response to a signal u, it habituates in the same fashion if u is shifted to a later time (due to time invariance, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6a and b</ref>). Linearity implies that the response to u can be superimposed with the response to the time-shifted u to obtain the response to the combined inputs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6c</ref>). However, if the system habituates, more specifically respects hallmark H 1 , it responds differently to only the time-shifted u than to the superposition of u and the time-shifted u (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6c and d differ</ref>).</p><p>As a preparation to Proposition 3.1, let a dynamical system be defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(T , U , Y , B)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where T â R is a set of time points and U and Y are sets of functions on T that describe stimulus and responses, respectively. B is the subset of all functions from T to (U Ã Y ) that describe the behavior of the system, i.e., (u Ã y) â U Ã Y implies the system can react with the response y(t), t â T to the stimulus u(t), t â T . A dynamical system ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">5</ref>) is said to be linear, if, for any (u 1 , y 1 ) â B, (u 2 , y 2 ) â B and any c 1 â R, c 2 â R, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(c 1 u 1 + c 2 u 2 , c 1 y 1 + c 2 y 2 ) â B.<label>(6)</label></formula><p>A dynamical system (5) is said to be time-invariant, if, for any t â² â T and any (u, y) â B, we have (u â² , y â² ) â B, where u â² is defined by u â² (t) = u(t ât â² ) and y â² (t) is defined accordingly.</p><p>Proposition 3.1. A linear time-invariant system with a nonnegative output cannot respect hallmark H 1 and thus cannot habituate.</p><p>Proof. We assume there exists a system with the stated properties that respects hallmark H 1 and show that a contradiction results. We assume without restriction that the system state is the origin and y = 0 before the first stimulus applies.</p><p>Let u be a sequence of L stimuli with period T , where the first stimulus occurs at t = 0.

Since the system is time-invariant, (u, y) â B implies (u â² , y â² ) â B. Since the system fulfills hallmark H 1 by assumption, we have y[0] &gt; y[k] for all k â N, since there exists a K &gt; 0 such that y[k], k = 0, . . . , K is strictly decreasing.

Since linear systems and their outputs are unbounded according to the superposition principle, it is tempting to infer that linear systems cannot habituate from the assumption of bounded outputs alone. Input signals to living systems are, however, also bounded, and properties like bounded-input-bounded-output stability suggest bounded outputs can be ensured under certain assumptions on the input signals. As a result, the mere statement that linear systems are ruled out here due to their unboundedness is arguably not satisfactory. Proposition 3.1 and its proof make the statement clearer. Note that boundedness enters in (8) in the proof.</p></div>
