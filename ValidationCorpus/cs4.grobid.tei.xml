<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In this review, we consider the radiative transport equation (RTE). The equation governs transport phenomena in which particles are scattered and absorbed in a medium but the scattering among the particles can be neglected. The RTE is a type of the linear Boltzmann equation. In the RTE, the speed of particles is quite often assumed to be a constant. Light propagation in random media is governed by the RTE since the light propagation can be viewed as moving particles which undergo scattering and absorption <ref type="bibr">(Ishimaru, 1978)</ref>. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carminati and Schotland, 2021</ref> for the relation between Maxwell's equations and the RTE. Random media (i.e., media in which scattering and absorption occur randomly) include fog, cloud, biological tissue, and the interstellar medium. Moreover, neutrons in a reactor obey the RTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Duderstadt and Martin, 1979)</ref>. In most parts of this review, we assume that the absorption coefficient 𝜇 " and scattering coefficient 𝜇 # are constants.</p><p>The singular-eigenfunction approach was explored as early as 1945 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Davison, 1945</ref>. After some further efforts such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Van Kampen, 1955</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Davison, 1957</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">, and Wigner, 1961</ref>, Case established a way of finding solutions with separation of variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Case, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Case, 1960)</ref>. In 1960, Case considered the time-independent one-dimensional radiative transport equation with isotropic scattering and solved the equation with separation of variables by finding singular eigenfunctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Case, 1960)</ref>. The method was soon extended to the case of anisotropic scattering without <ref type="bibr">(McCormick and Kuscer, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Mika, 1961)</ref> and with <ref type="bibr">(McCormick and Kuscer, 1966)</ref> azimuthal dependence. In this singular-eigenfunction approach, solutions to the one-dimensional radiative transport equation are given by a superposition of singular eigenfunctions. The existence and uniqueness of such solutions were proved <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Larsen, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Larsen, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Larsen and Habetler, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Larsen, Sancaktar, and Zweifel, 1975</ref>). Case's approach was revisited recently and the RTE for isotropic scattering was considered in half spaces of arbitrary dimension <ref type="bibr">(d'Eon and McCormick, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In 1964, Dede used rotated reference frames to solve the three-dimensional radiative transport equation with the spherical-harmonic approximation (cf., the 𝑃 ! method) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dede, 1964)</ref>. Dede pointed out that equations in three dimensions reduce to one-dimensional equations if reference frames are rotated in the direction of the Fourier vector. Kobayashi developed Dedeʼs calculation and computed coefficients in the spherical-harmonic expansion by solving a threeterm recurrence relation recursively starting with the initial term <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kobayashi, 1977)</ref>. Numerical calculation was performed for a two-dimensional rectangular domain in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kobayashi, 1977.</ref> In 2004, Markel independently arrived at rotated reference frames and obtained the coefficients in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the tridiagonal matrix originating from the three-term recurrence relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Markel, 2004)</ref>. By computing the specific intensity for a three-dimensional infinite medium, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Markel, 2004</ref>, it was showed that the algorithm is efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Markel, 2004)</ref>. Moreover it was found that complex unit vectors can be used to rotate reference frames <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Panasyuk, Schotland, and Markel, 2006)</ref>. The new formulation can be viewed as separation of variables in which the eigenvalues are separation constants <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Schotland and Markel, 2007)</ref>. This generalization made it possible to solve boundary value problems in the form of plane-wave decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Machida, Panasyuk, Schotland, and Markel, 2010)</ref>. The series of numerical algorithms started with <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Markel, 2004</ref> was named the method of rotated reference frames.</p><p>Until this point, the notion of rotated reference frames had always come together with the spherical-harmonic expansion of the specific intensity. Then it was realized that the technique of rotated reference frames is not necessarily linked to spherical harmonics, and singular eigenfunctions in the one-dimensional transport theory were extended to three dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Machida, 2014)</ref>. In particular, the fundamental solution with singular eigenfunctions of the onedimensional RTE for anisotropic scattering could be extended to three dimensions. Indeed, the method of rotated reference frames is a three-dimensional extension of the spherical-harmonic expansion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barichello, Garcia, and Siewert, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sanchez and McCormick, 1982)</ref> in Caseology (the singular-eigenfunction approach started by Case). Using singular eigenfunctions, the fundamental solution of the RTE was obtained in flatland (i.e., two-dimensional space) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Machida, 2016b)</ref>.</p></div>

As described above, we will assume that 𝜇 " , 𝜇 # are constants unless otherwise stated. The sum of these optical parameters is called the total attenuation 𝜇 ( = 𝜇 " + 𝜇 # . The scattering phase function 𝑝(𝐬 &amp;, 𝐬 &amp; &amp; ), described below, can depend on 𝐫 but this dependence is neglected. On the right-hand side, 𝑆(𝐫, 𝐬 &amp;, 𝑡) is the source term.

For a unit vector 𝐤 i (i.e., 𝐤 i • 𝐤 i = 𝑘 k + % + 𝑘 k , % + 𝑘 k - % = 1), we introduce an operator ℛ 𝐤 / that rotates the reference frame so that the 𝑧-axis lies in the direction of 𝐤 i . For example, we can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ℛ 𝐤 / cos 𝜃 = ℛ 𝐤 / 𝐬 &amp; • 𝐳 &amp; = 𝐬 &amp; • 𝐤 i ,</formula><p>(2.9) where 𝐳 &amp; is a unit vector in the direction of the positive 𝑧-axis. Later, we will define the operator ℛ 𝐤 / using Wigner's 𝐷-matrices. But for now, let us understand ℛ 𝐤 / rather intuitively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The first example of rotated reference frames for the RTE</head><p>Let us begin with the following homogeneous RTE. We assume that 𝜇 ( , 𝜇 # are positive constants.

The separation constant 𝜈 is known to be continuous in (−1,1) and has two discrete values ±𝜈 * (𝜈 * &gt; 1), where they are solutions to the following transcendental equation <ref type="bibr">(Case and Zweifel, 1967)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">1 − 𝜛𝜈 * tanh 06 1 𝜈 * = 0 .

The choice of the unit vector 𝐤 i is arbitrary at this moment. Later, when we obtain the fundamental solution or solve boundary-value problems, suitable 𝐤 i will be chosen. The unit vector 𝐤 i is not necessarily a real vector. Indeed, as described in Sec. 4, we will consider complex vectors 𝐤 i ∈ ℂ 7 (ℂ denotes the set of complex numbers).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.1.">Optical tomography</head><p>Light propagation in biological tissue is governed by the RTE. On a large scale, say the propagation distance is 1cm when the transport mean free path is 1mm, the solution to the diffusion equation becomes almost identical to the solution of the RTE. Optical tomography is formulated as inverse problems which determine coefficients of the RTE or diffusion equation. The diffusion equation is usually used for optical tomography because the equation is easier to solve. Hence the tomography is often called diffuse optical tomography <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arridge, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Boas, et al., 2001)</ref>. The use of the RTE is difficult in general because the forward problem must be solved repeatedly when the inverse problem is solved in any ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arridge, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arridge and Schotland, 2009)</ref>. Although the numerical cost of algorithms such as finite-difference and finiteelement methods, and Monte Carlo simulation is high, one way to achieve optical tomography based on the RTE is to use rotated reference frames.</p><p>Here, we consider the reconstruction of 𝜇 " in the RTE from boundary measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Machida, et al., 2016)</ref>. When the reconstruction is performed, direct reconstruction methods offer an alternative approach to iterative algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arridge and Schotland, 2009)</ref>. By direct reconstruction, we mean the use of inversion formulas and associated fast algorithms. In particular, we will employ the Rytov approximation.</p><p>In the experiment, the target (a lemon slice or a lotus root slice of thickness approximately 4mm) was placed in the middle of a sample chamber of width 𝐿 =1cm. The background medium consists of 0.7% Intralipid plus 0.07% India ink. Near-infrared light in this box obeys the RTE for the slab geometry.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">Concluding remarks</head><p>When the three-dimensional RTE is solved by separation of variables, separated solutions have a connection to separated solutions for the one-dimensional RTE via rotated reference frames. By making use of this connection, the three-dimensional RTE can be solved using the knowledge of the one-dimensional transport theory.</p><p>It is certainly a limitation that coefficients 𝜇 " , 𝜇 # must be constant. One of the reasons that the RTE with constant coefficients is still worth being studied is benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ganapol, 2008)</ref>. Since the analytical and numerical solutions presented in this review are quite accurate, they can be used for benchmark. When absorption and scattering coefficients spatially vary, it is possible to treat the spatially varying part as perturbation. In 10.1, 𝜇 " (𝐫) is reconstructed using solutions of the RTE obtained with rotated reference frames.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acknowledgements</head><p>The author started the research on the RTE and rotated reference frames when he was a postdoc of John C. Schotland and Vadim A. Markel, which he greatly appreciates. To deepen the theory on the RTE with rotated reference frames, fruitful discussion on the occasion of the International Conference on Transport Theory (ICTT), which have been held every other year, was crucial. This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP17K05572 and JST PRESTO Grant Number JPMJPR2027.</p></div>
