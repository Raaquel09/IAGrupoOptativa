<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Te present GPS (global positioning system) is widely used in electric vehicle navigation; it is usually installed in the middle-torear position on the car's roof, near the rear windshield. Since the GPS antenna operating frequency is 1.575 GHz, the health risk of the passengers in the car in this high-frequency electromagnetic exposure is a matter of concern. In this paper, we construct models for a GPS antenna, an electric vehicle, and a human body. Trough the multiphysics feld coupling calculation in COMSOL Multiphysics, a fnite element simulation software, in both frequency domain and transient analysis, we obtain the electric feld strength distribution, specifc absorption rate, and temperature distribution of the human body at three positions inside the electric vehicle after being exposed to the GPS antenna radiation for 30 minutes. Te peak human-induced electric feld is 18.4 V/m, and the peak specifc absorption rate is 0.193 W/kg. Te 30 minute average maximum human-induced electric feld is 1.6906 V/m, which is 3.1% of the ICNIRP limit, the 30 minute average whole-body SAR is 0.0036 W/kg, which is 4.5% of the ICNIRP limit, and the 30 minute average human core temperature rise is 0.06 Â°C, which is 6% of the ICNIRP limit. In addition, we simulate the impact of three diferent vehicle shell materials on the level of electromagnetic exposure to the human body, which can provide reference for electromagnetic shielding design in automobiles. Te results indicate that the induced electric feld strength, specifc absorption rate (SAR), and temperature rise in various parts of the human body did not exceed the standard limits in the latest version of ICNIRP. Tis suggests that the electromagnetic exposure from the GPS antenna in a typical automotive environment does not pose a threat to human health.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, under the strong support and promotion of national policies, new energy electric vehicles have emerged, and antenna is an important part of the radio communication and detection system in electric vehicles. Te GPS antenna used in electric vehicles emits high-frequency radiation, which has led to increasing concerns about the biological efects of exposure to high-frequency and radio-frequency electromagnetic felds in the range of 100 kHz to 300 GHz. GPS has 24 satellites, including 21 working satellites and 3 backup satellites, and theoretically GPS receivers should be able to receive signals from 4 to 11 satellites at any location on Earth at any time; therefore, the system can provide accurate and continuous three-dimensional position, velocity, and time information to users with appropriate receivers. Te GPS antenna used in electric vehicles operates at a transmission frequency of 1575.42 MHz (L1 band) and 1227.6 MHz (L2 band), providing separate services for civil and military use, respectively. Circularly polarized microstrip antennas are commonly used as GPS antennas due to their lightweight, cost-efectiveness, and ability to provide omnidirectional coverage, making them popular in radar systems and mobile satellite communication as well. Tese antennas ofer the advantage of enabling an omnidirectional orientation between the transmitter and receiver, allowing for efcient signal reception and transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. In the 1970s, microstrip antennas emerged as a new antenna concept. Subsequently, microstrip antennas studied by R. E. Munson and J. Q. Howell were applied as conformal omnidirectional antennas on rockets and missiles. With further research, microstrip antennas have been widely used in broadband radio devices ranging from 100 MHz to 100 GHz, particularly in aircraft and electric vehicles.</p><p>In electric vehicles, where passengers sit very close to the electrical system and antennas, the high currents generated in these vehicles mean that passengers may be exposed to signifcant electromagnetic felds <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In 1990, Tsukahara and Hirano used numerical analysis to calculate the electric feld in the passenger compartment for vehicle surface currents and diferent plane wave exposures <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In 2003, Shiraki et al. conducted a study on the electromagnetic radiation generated by electronic devices inside a vehicle. Te study employed a hybrid method combining the time-domain fnite diference method and transmission line technique. Tis approach was utilized to determine the optimal placement of the FM radio antenna within the vehicle <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In 2015, Vassilev et al. measured the magnetic felds inside eight diferent electric vehicles (including battery, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell types) with diferent motor technologies (brush DC, permanent magnet synchronous, and induction) at frequencies of up to 10 MHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In 2019, Alessandro Arduino examined the accuracy of numerical dosimetric simulations in the context of human exposure to an electric vehicle electrostatic induction charging system. Te study focuses on two optional numerical methods: the electric vector potential formulation and the electric scalar potential formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In the same year, Gombarska et al. conducted a study using an omnidirectional 8 dBi antenna to measure the electric feld intensity generated by in-vehicle communication devices and highfrequency electronic devices within the 500 MHz-3300 MHz frequency range. Te study demonstrated that the exposure to the electromagnetic environment in electric vehicles did not exceed the established safe range <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In addition, Shah and Yoo et al. conducted measurements to assess the exposure of manikins with implanted pacemakers to electromagnetic felds emitted by electric vehicle wireless power transmission systems. Te study revealed that passengers with neurostimulation implants and implanted hip joints with prostheses experienced specifc absorption rate (SAR) values exceeding the established safety standard by more than 10 g of human tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In 2021, WenTing and Mai conducted an evaluation of the safety of electromagnetic exposure to the human central nervous system from an electric vehicle magnetically coupled resonance wireless charging system. Te study demonstrated that the maximum magnetic induction and electric feld strengths in the human head were measured as 0.9 Î¼T and 0.18 V/m, respectively. Tese values were found to be below the public exposure limits set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, which are 27 Î¼T for magnetic induction and 2.97 V/m for electric feld strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In the same year, De Santis et al. conducted an evaluation of external magnetic felds emitted by wireless power transfer (WPT) systems and internal electric felds generated by human models during the charging process of small electric vehicles (EVs). Te study revealed that the obtained results exceeded the reference levels set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) in the driving position <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Te efects of high-frequency electromagnetic felds generated by antennas on human health have been studied for decades. In 1993, Dimbylow conducted a study where they used the fnite diference in time domain (FDTD) method to calculate the radiation emitted by a dipole antenna on a realistic head model. Teir analysis led to the conclusion that highly conductive tissues have a greater tendency to absorb the energy preferentially <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In 2008, Yu et al. simulated the electromagnetic characteristics of a whip antenna of a car at diferent positions based on the CST FIT technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In 2009, Hirata and Ida conducted a simulation study where they exposed a vehicle to a highfrequency electromagnetic environment, including radar and antennas. Teir fndings revealed that the presence of the human body model led to the suppression of standing waves near the vehicle's dashboard. Tis suppression was attributed to the power absorption of the human body, particularly in the frequency range of 100-200 MHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Wessapan et al. investigated the specifc absorption rate (SAR) distribution and temperature feld distribution of a real human body model subjected to electromagnetic radiation from antennas operating at 900 MHz and 1800 MHz, respectively, as infuenced by the operating frequency and the size of the distance between the antenna and the human head <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In 2021, Kumar and Imaculate presented a hybrid half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW) diplex antenna for on-body transceiver application with two resonant frequencies of 4 GHz and 4.79 GHz. Tis literature has simulated the radiation from the antenna to the human head and body and verifed the specifc absorption rate. Due to the unidirectional nature of the radiation from this antenna, the SAR values are low <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>At present, investigations have revealed that the research on the impact of high-frequency environments in electric vehicles on the human body is still not very comprehensive, particularly in the context of the efects of onboard antennas on human subjects. And in this paper, multiphysics feld coupling calculations are performed. A comprehensive assessment of the safety of human electromagnetic exposure has been carried out in COMSOL software. We simulated not only the EM-induced E-feld distribution and SAR distribution of the human body but also the whole-body average induced E-feld, SAR, and head temperature feld distributions after 30 minutes of EM irradiation environment, and then compared the results with the latest international standard ICNIRP (2020). In addition, I believe that the research methodology used in this study can signifcantly reduce the computational efort of similar research endeavours, providing a more economical and efcient approach.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">GPS Antenna Design Principle.</head><p>In this paper, we present the design of a right-handed circularly polarized GPS receiving antenna. Te antenna is fed by a coaxial probe, with a center frequency of 1.575 GHz. To achieve circular polarization, an angle cut is employed, ensuring that the antenna radiates circularly polarized waves. Te axis ratio of the circularly polarized wave at the center frequency is maintained at less than 2.0 dB. Te excitation source of the model is a voltage source, the excitation source is a sinusoidal voltage signal excitation, the amplitude is set to 1 V, the impedance is 50 Î©, the input power is 20 mw, and the excitation source is set at the base of the antenna <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Tere are two ways to feed the rectangular microstrip antenna to obtain circular polarization characteristics, one is single point feed and the other is orthogonal double feed. Te GPS antenna model used in this paper is a single-point fed tangential circularly polarized microstrip patch antenna. By a special feeding method, the circularly polarized rectangular patch microstrip antenna can be obtained. Te key to circular polarization is to excite a line polarization wave with two polarization directions of equal orthogonal amplitude and 90 Â°phase diference. According to the cavity mode theory, a single rectangular microstrip antenna fed by a point can produce two simple parallel modes with equal polarization orthogonal amplitude but cannot form a 90 Â°phase diference. In order to form a 90 Â°phase diference between the simple and parallel modes, a simple and parallel mode separation unit is introduced in the regular shape of the single microstrip antenna, the most common form of separation unit is to cut the corner on the two diagonals of the rectangular patch, so that the resonant frequency of the simple and orthogonal modes are separated, and the operating frequency is chosen between the two frequencies. When the size of the simple parallel mode separation unit is appropriately selected, it results in the formation of circular polarization radiation. Specifcally, at the operating frequency, the equivalent impedance of one mode exhibits a phase angle leading by 45%, while the equivalent impedance of another mode lags by 45%. Tis phase diference between the modes facilitates the generation of circularly polarized radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>

Te conductor within the coaxial line is connected to the radiation patch through the dielectric substrate. By identifying the correct location for the feed point, a favorable match can be achieved. In order to design a right circularly polarized microstrip antenna, it is necessary to relocate the coaxial line feed point to the position depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In addition, two appropriately sized isosceles triangles need to be cut out at the opposite corners of the square metal patch.</p><p>Based on the dielectric substrate parameters, we can employ calculations from formulas (1) to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> to determine the resonant frequency of 1.575 GHz for the initial size of the radiation patch. By adjusting the width W and length L of the radiation patch, as well as the side length of the square dielectric substrate (Length), we can set the distance d p and the tangent triangle waist length a from the center of the fne-tuned feed point to generate circularly polarized waves <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Te position of the coaxial feed point with an input impedance of 50 Î© is estimated based on the dielectric substrate parameters and the initial size of the radiating patch. Te actual size of the radiating patch and the precise position of the 50 Î© feed point at the resonant frequency of 1.575 GHz are determined through parametric scan analysis. Te optimization objective is to achieve a return loss of less than â 20 dB, an axial ratio of less than 3 dB, and a radiation patch size and feed point position that meet the design requirements.</p><p>For the rectangular microstrip antenna operating at frequency f, the width w of the high-efciency radiation patch can be designed using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">w ï¿½ c 2f Îµ r + 1 2 ô¼ ô¼ â (1/2) , (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where c is the speed of light and Îµ r is the permittivity of the dielectric substrate.

(<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>First, the size of the patch is estimated using equation (2). Te antenna structure consists of the patch, dielectric substrate, and ground plane, with their material parameters shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Te patch, ground plane, inner conductor, and outer conductor of the coaxial cable are assumed to be ideal conductors. An air domain in the shape of a sphere is set outside the antenna and truncated by a perfectly matched layer (PML) to absorb all radiation. To analyze the electromagnetic waves more accurately, all domains are divided into grids, with the maximum grid size not exceeding one-ffth of the wavelength. Te antenna is excited by a coaxial collector port with an input voltage of 1 V and a relative dielectric constant of 1. Te port is located on the bottom surface of the coaxial-fed outer cylindrical structure. Due to the high input impedance at the edge of the patch and low input impedance at the center, the position of the coaxial feed cable needs to be adjusted to match the 50 Î© reference impedance. In addition, to fnd the resonance point at 1.575 GHz, a parameterized scan of the chamfer size of the patch is performed. Te main process of the parameter scan is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the design results are given, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. In practice, the shell of the antenna is mostly of shark fn shape. Te material is carbon fber, because it has very little efect on the antenna radiation characteristics, so in order to simplify the calculation, the antenna shell is designed into a square model with side length of 120 mm, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>

In March 2020, ICNIRP published the latest edition of the ICNIRP Guidelines for human protection against exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic felds (emf ) in the range of 100 kHz-300 GHz (referred to as "RF"). According to the latest ICNIRP guidelines (2020), for frequencies ranging from 30 MHz to 2 GHz, in the far-feld region, compliance is demonstrated if the incident power density, incident electric feld strength, or incident magnetic feld strength (only one of them is required) does not exceed the reference levels. Te safety limits for public human-induced electric feld exposure in electromagnetic felds from 100 kHz to 300 GHz for an average of 30 minutes are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref>, and the reference levels for whole-body exposures for an average of 30 minutes are shown in Table 8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Whole-body average SAR values are to be averaged over the entire body and over a 30 minute period. Te 30 minute averaging time is International Journal of Antennas and Propagation intended to take into account the time required to reach a steady-state temperature, while requiring that the wholebody human body warming value does not exceed 1 Â°C. Te frequency of the GPS antenna is 1.575 GHz. Corresponding to the data in the table, the safety limit of the human body-induced electric feld at this frequency is 54.57 V/m, and the safety limit of the whole body average SAR is 0.08 W/kg.</p></div>

Te substrate material employed is RO3003, which has a conductivity of 2.2 Ã 10 â 4 S/m. Te ground surface is set as PEC (perfect electrical conductor). Te UHF RFID antennas were located at a distance of 5 cm to the closest surface of the human body. In the exposed scenario, there are three antennas. Te center height of the lower antenna is 626 mm, that of the middle antenna is 1018 mm, and that of the upper antenna is 1410 mm, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>.

In order to assess the accuracy of the simulation, the obtained SAR values were compared with the corresponding values reported in the literature.

Te error ratio of 1.67%, which is within the permissible range of error, due to the diferent selection of the mesh sectioning fneness of the COMSOL software as well as the computational diferences between diferent software, will inevitably result in the existence of errors. Te validation is primarily aimed at confrming the accuracy of  the theories, methods, and COMSOL software employed in this study. Tis paper constructed a microstrip patch antenna model of the same type as described in the literature. Te model was utilized to simulate the electromagnetic feld distribution when a human body is exposed to the electromagnetic environment of the antenna. A comparison of the results revealed errors of less than 5%, indicating that the methods and software utilized in this study are suitable for electromagnetic simulation calculations involving human subjects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Human SAR Distribution.</head><p>For high-frequency electromagnetic radiation, the applied electric feld will produce an induced electric feld in the human body, and human tissues are lossy media, so there will be a current generated by the electric feld, absorbing and dissipating electromagnetic energy, thus the electric feld causes a heating efect on human tissues. According to the safety guidelines of ICNIRP, the exposure threshold for the general public is generally 0.08 W/kg, which has been widely used in recent years in bioelectromagnetic exposure studies.

Comparing with Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">13</ref>, it can be seen that as the electromagnetic wave generated by the antenna penetrates the human head model, the SAR value is highest in the scalp layer of the human head model, decreases after passing through the skull layer, and is lowest after entering the cerebrum layer.

Te space averaged induced electric feld strength values, whole body averaged SAR, temperature rise values, and ICNIRP limit comparisons for the human body model when the vehicle GPS antenna is operated continuously for 30 minutes at an operating frequency of 1.575 GHz are given in detail in Table 14.

Te shell materials were set as PEC, aluminum alloy, and carbon fber, with their respective dielectric parameters shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">16</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">17</ref> provides a detailed comparison of the spatial average induced electric feld strength, whole-body average SAR value, temperature rise, and ICNIRP limit when the vehicle-mounted GPS antenna operates continuously for 30 minutes at a frequency of 1.575 GHz.   Te data indicate that the average whole-body exposure level of the human body is signifcantly below the ICNIRP standard limits. Among the diferent vehicle shell materials, carbon fber material results in the highest exposure to electromagnetic radiation. At a frequency of 1.575 GHz, materials with higher relative permittivity and electrical conductivity exhibit better electromagnetic radiation shielding capabilities. Materials with higher relative permittivity cause a slowdown in the propagation of electromagnetic waves within the material, providing better electromagnetic radiation shielding. Materials with high electrical conductivity can efectively absorb and conduct    electromagnetic radiation energy, reducing its propagation. However, carbon fber materials exhibit relatively weaker absorption capabilities in the high-frequency range. Te data presented in this study can provide some reference for the electromagnetic shielding design of vehicles. However, the optimal choice of shielding materials still depends on specifc application requirements and design needs, necessitating practical testing and evaluation to determine the most suitable materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we investigate the electromagnetic exposure generated by the GPS antenna of an electric vehicle. Specifcally, we focus on evaluating the induced electric feld and the specifc absorption rate (SAR) in various tissues of the adult human torso, as well as the three layers of tissues in the scalp, skull, and cerebrum. Our simulations were conducted for three diferent seating positions: the rear middle seat, the rear window seat, and the driver's seat. To perform these simulations, we employed a multiphysics feld approach, utilizing both frequency domain and transient coupling techniques in the COMSOL software.</p><p>Te purpose is to comprehensively analyze the potential harm caused by the electromagnetic feld generated by the GPS antenna. We can also see that the electromagnetic feld generated by the GPS is unevenly and unconcentratedly distributed everywhere in the EV. Te peak value of humaninduced electric feld is 18.4 V/m, and the peak value of specifc absorption rate is 0.193 W/kg. Te average maximum value of human-induced electric feld in 30 minutes is 1.6906 V/m, which is 3.1% of the ICNIRP limit; the 30 minute average whole-body SAR maximum is 0.0036 W/kg, which is 4.5% of the ICNIRP limit; and the 30 minute maximum body core temperature rise is 0.06 Â°C, which is 6% of the ICNIRP limit.</p><p>Based on the literature review, the advantages of this paper compared to previous similar works are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">18</ref>.</p><p>According to the simulations conducted in this study under specifc conditions, the radiation levels of the GPS antenna are considered safe and within the limits set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). However, in real-world situations, the electromagnetic radiation from in-vehicle GPS antennas is subject to various limitations. For instance, from a material perspective, diferent materials used for the GPS antenna and vehicle shell exhibit diferent dielectric properties, which can afect the propagation of electromagnetic waves in and around the antenna, thus infuencing the intensity and range of electromagnetic radiation. In terms of time, prolonged operation of the GPS antenna can increase the amount of electromagnetic radiation exposure to the human body. Terefore, when designing and using GPS systems, it is important to consider multiple factors for control and limitation to ensure that human exposure remains within safe levels.</p><p>Te induced electric feld strength, specifc absorption rate (SAR) value, and temperature rise in the human body resulting from exposure to the EV GPS antenna are infuenced by numerous complex factors. Tese factors include the operating frequency of the antenna, dielectric properties of the tissues, thermal properties, blood irrigation rate, and more. Further research will focus on developing more realistic human body and antenna models to provide detailed explanations regarding the potential safety risks associated with electromagnetic irradiation from the EV GPS antenna. Ongoing investigations and research into the efects of EV GPS antenna radiation will enhance our understanding of potential risks and help ensure that electromagnetic exposure remains within acceptable limits to protect human health.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 Figure 1 :</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Figure 1: GPS single point fed circularly polarized microstrip antenna structure.</figDesc></figure>
