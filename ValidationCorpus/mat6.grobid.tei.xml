<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction and statement of results</head><p>A substantial part of the effort and most of the tools discussed in this paper are directed at the following problems that are seemingly unrelated:</p><p>(a) Using the regularity theory for the complex Monge-Ampère equation on bounded domains Ω ⋐ C n , n ≥ 2, to estimate the Kobayashi pseudometric k Ω (z; •) in terms of dist(z, ∂Ω). (b) A Picard-type extension theorem for holomorphic mappings into a domain Ω C n , n ≥ 2,</p><p>where Ω is not the complement of a divisor. The theme that links these problems is a weak notion of negative curvature for the metric space (Ω, K Ω ), where K Ω denotes the Kobayashi pseudodistance (assumed to be a distance on domains considered in this paper). This negative-curvature-type property, called visibility, is that, loosely speaking, geodesic lines for K Ω joining two distinct points in ∂Ω must bend into Ω with some mild geometric control (reminiscent of the Poincaré disc model of the hyperbolic plane).</p><p>If the metric space (Ω, K Ω ) is Cauchy-complete, then any two points in Ω are joined by a geodesic (i.e., a path σ : I → Ω, where I is an interval, that satisfies K Ω (σ(t), σ(s)) = |t − s| for all s, t ∈ I). But when n ≥ 2, it is a very hard problem to tell whether, given a domain Ω C n , (Ω, K Ω ) is Cauchy-complete (even when Ω is pseudoconvex). Therefore, for the domains considered in this paper, (Ω, K Ω ) will not be assumed to be Cauchy-complete. Thus, a formal definition of visibility (which will be provided in Section 1.2) needs to be more refined than the picture described above. This raises the question: when does a domain have the visibility property? Conditions on the quantitative behaviour of the Kobayashi pseudometric form a part of the answer to this question. This motivates our results on the Kobayashi pseudometric.</p><p>1.1. Lower bounds for the Kobayashi pseudometric. Our results on the Kobayashi pseudometric are inspired by a well-known result of Diederich-Fornaess [10, <ref type="bibr">Theorem 4]</ref>, which provides a lower bound for the Kobayashi pseudometric k Ω of a bounded pseudoconvex domain Ω ⊂ C n with real-analytic boundary. The lower bound that they deduce for k Ω (z; v), (z, v) ∈ Ω × C n , is in terms of some positive power of (1/dist(z, ∂Ω)), and has many applications. These applications are, in part, the reason for our interest in extending such an estimate to domains with just C 2 -smooth boundary.</p><p>Before we state our first theorem, some notation: if A and B are real quantities, A B will denote that there exists a constant c &gt; 0 that is independent of all parameters determining A and B such that A ≥ cB. In what follows, L Ω will denote the Levi form of ∂Ω determined by some fixed, but unspecified, defining function for Ω (see Remark 1.2), and H ξ (∂Ω) := T ξ (∂Ω)∩i T ξ (∂Ω) will denote the maximal complex subspace of T ξ (∂Ω): the tangent space of ∂Ω at ξ. For any z ∈ Ω, we shall abbreviate dist(z, ∂Ω) to δ Ω (z).</p><p>Theorem 1.1. Let Ω ⊂ C n , n ≥ 2, be a bounded pseudoconvex domain having C 2 -smooth boundary. Assume that there exists a C 2 -smooth closed submanifold of ∂Ω such that S is totallyreal and such that w(∂Ω) ⊂ S. Suppose there exists a number m &gt; 2 such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L Ω (ξ; v) dist(ξ, S) m−2 v 2 ∀v ∈ H ξ (∂Ω) and ∀ξ ∈ ∂Ω \ S.</formula><p>(1.1)</p><p>Then, there exists a constant c &gt; 0 such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">k Ω (z; v) ≥ c v δ Ω (z) 1/m ∀z ∈ Ω and ∀v ∈ C n . (1.2)</formula><p>Remark 1.2. Strictly speaking, L Ω requires a choice of defining function for it to be completely determined. But since, for Ω as above, two defining functions differ by a C 2 -smooth factor that is non-vanishing in a neighbourhood of ∂Ω, and given the expressions for H ξ (∂Ω) in terms of each defining function, the inequality (1.1) makes sense even though no defining function is specified. Note also that (1.1) does not preclude the case w(∂Ω) = ∅, where w(∂Ω) denotes the set of points in ∂Ω at which ∂Ω is weakly Levi pseudoconvex.</p><p>On a first reading, the estimate (1.2) might seem unsurprising. However, to the best of our knowledge, estimates of the form (1.2) seen in the literature that are well-argued do not, for Ω weakly pseudoconvex, provide an explicit exponent of δ Ω . Moreover, there are more significant reasons for placing the estimate (1.2) on record. Namely:</p><p>• For bounded, weakly pseudoconvex, finite-type domains Ω with ∂Ω not real analytic, lower bounds for k Ω resembling (1.2) have been asserted on many occasions -the earliest such instance being <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Each such claim has, eventually, relied on the difficult half of the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> by Catlin. There seems to be a certain deficit in understanding the latter work -nor is there any alternative exposition on the efficacy of a geometric construction called a boundary system on which the proofs of the above-mentioned assertions rely. • We introduce a method relying on the regularity theory for the complex Monge-Ampère equation to derive lower bounds of the form (1.2). One way of deriving such an estimate is to construct plurisubharmonic peak functions satisfying certain precise estimates; see, for instance, [10, Theorem 2], <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">Proposition 4.2]</ref>. Similar peak functions, but with less restrictive requirements, are useful in proving the existence and regularity of solutions of the complex Monge-Ampère equation, as one would expect from the proof of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 6.2]</ref>. This underlies -in view of a result of Sibony <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> -an effective and less technical method for deriving lower bounds for the Kobayashi metric. The latter point is substantiated by a general result whose proof (similar to that of Theorem 1.1) is the method alluded to. For its exact statement, we refer the reader to Theorem 4.2.</p><p>1.2. Visibility and a Picard-type extension theorem. One of the objectives of this work is to present a new application of visibility. This is the Picard-type extension theorem alluded to above. Both sentences call for definitions. First, we must formalise the rough idea of visibility hinted at above. We shall say that a domain Ω is Kobayashi hyperbolic if K Ω is a distance.</p><p>The property of ∂Ω being visible is closely related to the notion of Ω being a visibility domain, which was introduced by Bharali-Zimmer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. If Ω is bounded, then the two notions are equivalent. We shall not define visibility domains here. Instead, we will work with the properties introduced in Definition 1.3; these are closer to the terminology in Sarkar's article <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which contributes a key idea to the proof of one of the theorems in this section. Recall the discussion on the difficulty of knowing whether (Ω, K Ω ) admits geodesics: (λ, κ)-almost-geodesics (see Section 2 for their definition) serve as substitutes for geodesics. This is because if Ω is Kobayashi hyperbolic, then (regardless of whether (Ω, K Ω ) is Cauchy-complete) for any z, w ∈ Ω, z = w, and any κ &gt; 0, there exists a (1, κ)-almost-geodesic joining z and w [3, <ref type="bibr">Proposition 5.3]</ref>.</p><p>Visibility of ∂Ω has been used to deduce properties of holomorphic mappings into Ω -ranging from their continuous extendability to Ω, to the iterative dynamics of such maps -which are too numerous to mention here. Instead, we refer readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Given this, it is desirable to identify families of unbounded domains Ω C n such that ∂Ω is visible. A rich collection of planar domains with the latter property that also satisfy other metrical conditions, and domains in C n , n ≥ 2, with the latter property and having rather wild boundaries, have been constructed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. But, given an unbounded domain Ω C n , n ≥ 2, such that ∂Ω is C 2 -smooth, Levi pseudoconvex, but not strongly Levi pseudoconvex, are there conditions under which ∂Ω is visible? One of our theorems addresses this natural question. Why the interest in unbounded domains, one may ask. The answer will be evident when we discuss Picard-type theorems.</p><p>We present a condition for the visibility of ∂Ω that answers the question in italics stated above. The condition, roughly, is that with Ω as in the above question, the set of points at which ∂Ω is weakly Levi pseudoconvex, if non-empty, is small in a specific sense but not necessarily totally disconnected. The notation in the theorem below is as described prior to Theorem 1.1.</p><p>Theorem 1.4. Let Ω ⊂ C n , n ≥ 2, be an unbounded Kobayashi hyperbolic domain that is pseudoconvex and has C 2 -smooth boundary. Suppose there exists a C 2 -smooth closed 1-submanifold S of ∂Ω such that w(∂Ω) ⊂ S. Assume that for each p ∈ w(∂Ω), there exists a neighbourhood U p of p and m p &gt; 2 such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L Ω (ξ; v) dist(ξ, S) mp−2 v 2 ∀v ∈ H ξ (∂Ω) and ∀ξ ∈ (∂Ω ∩ U p ) \ S.</formula><p>Then, ∂Ω is visible.</p><p>Before we can present our next result, we need a general definition. Definition 1.5. Let Z be a complex manifold and Y a complex submanifold of Z. We say that Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Z if for every point p ∈ Y and for each neighbourhood U p of p in Z, there exists a neighbourhood</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V p of p in Z with V p ⋐ U p such that K Y V p ∩ Y, Y \ U p &gt; 0.</formula><p>The property of being hyperbolically imbedded is relevant to a class of extension theorems that we wish to examine further. The archetypal results of this class are: Result 1.6 (Kiernan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>: paraphrased for Y , Z manifolds). Let Z be a complex manifold and let Y ⊂ Z be a hyperbolically imbedded relatively compact submanifold.</p><p>(1) Then, every holomorphic map f : D * → Y extends as a holomorphic map f : D → Z.</p><p>(2) Let X be a complex manifold, let k = dim C (X), and let A X be an analytic subvariety of X of dimension (k − 1) having at most normal-crossing singularities. Then, any holomorphic map f : X \ A → Y extends as a holomorphic map f : X → Z.</p><p>Kwack had established a result of a similar nature under an analytical hypothesis [17, Theorem 3], whose proof is repurposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to prove (1) above. Although the hypothesis of ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is considerably more general than of (1), an inductive argument -enabled by the definition of a normal-crossing singularity -essentially reduces (2) to proving <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Theorems such as Result 1.6 are called Picard-type extension theorems. The reason for this terminology is as follows: if Z = CP 1 and Y = C \ {0, 1}, then (1) is equivalent to the Little Picard Theorem.</p><p>It is well known that the complement of (2n + 1) hyperplanes in general position in CP n is hyperbolically imbedded in CP n . Beyond examples resembling the latter, it is, in general, hard to tell when Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Z: Y, Z as above. It is natural to seek geometric conditions on Y that would lead to the same conclusions as Result 1.6. A good place to seek such a theorem (i.e., with more explicit geometric conditions on Y ) would be to start with</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Z = C n and Y a domain in C n . But observe that if Y</formula><p>C n is relatively compact, then the extension problem becomes trivial because of Riemann's removable singularities theorem. Thus, in the latter setting, we are compelled to focus on the the case when Y is an unbounded domain.</p><p>Theorem 1.7. Let Ω ⊂ C n , n ≥ 2, be an unbounded Kobayashi hyperbolic domain with the properties stated in Theorem 1.4. Let X be a complex manifold, let k = dim C (X), and let A X be an analytic subvariety of dimension (k − 1) having at most normal-crossing singularities. Then, any holomorphic map f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">X \ A → Ω extends as a continuous map f : X → (C n ) ∞ .</formula><p>Here, (C n ) ∞ denotes the one-point compactification of C n . Both Theorems 1.4 and 1.7 feature the same domain Ω. This is because, as in Result 1.6, Ω being hyperbolically imbedded continues to be crucial to f : X \ A → Ω admitting an extension with any degree of regularity. The latter condition follows if ∂Ω is visible; see Proposition 2.5 and the remark that precedes it. Thisin view of the discussion preceding Theorem 1.7 -is the reason for our interest in identifying unbounded visibility domains. Since Ω in Theorem 1.7 is not relatively compact, it does not follow from Result 1.6. Instead, we rely on the work of Joseph-Kwack <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>; see Result 6.1. Their work does not, however, provide any geometric conditions for a domain Ω, whether in C n or in some complex manifold, to be hyperbolically imbedded. The focus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is a set of functiontheoretic characterisations of hyperbolic imbedding. It is, therefore, natural to seek geometric conditions for a domain Ω C n to be hyperbolically imbedded. The hypothesis of Theorems 1.4 and 1.7 provides just such a condition. Moreover, domains satisfying the above hypothesis are abundant, as seen, for instance, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 3.2]</ref>. We conclude our introduction with one last question: could one extend Theorem 1.7 to domains X \ A such that A has worse singularities? The condition on A stems from our use of the work cited above. Moreover, we can show that -in the notation of Theorem 1.7 -a holomorphic map f : X \ A → Ω with Ω hyperbolically imbedded does not, in general, extend continuously to X if the singularities of A are even slightly worse than normal-crossing singularities; see Example 6.3.</p></div>

Let X and Y be domains in Z such that X Y Z.

Definition 2.2. Let Ω ⊂ C n be a domain and let I ⊂ R be an interval. For λ ≥ 1 and κ ≥ 0, a curve σ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">I → Ω is called a (λ, κ)-almost-geodesic if • λ −1 |t − s| − κ ≤ K Ω (σ(s), σ(t)) ≤ λ|t − s| + κ for every s, t ∈ I, and</formula><p>• σ is absolutely continuous (whereby σ ′ (t) exists for almost every t ∈ I) and k Ω (σ(t); σ ′ (t)) ≤ λ for almost every t ∈ I.</p><p>Next, we present a definition that formalises one of the sufficient conditions on a domain Ω ⊂ C n under which ∂Ω is visible. It is an adaptation, introduced by Bharali-Zimmer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, to unbounded domains of a well-known property. Definition 2.3. Let Ω ⊂ C n be a domain. We say that Ω satisfies a local interior-cone condition if for each R &gt; 0 there exist constants r 0 &gt; 0, θ ∈ (0, π), and a compact subset K ⊂ Ω, which depend on R, such that for each z ∈ B n (0, R) ∩ (Ω \ K), there is a point ξ z ∈ ∂Ω and a unit vector v z such that • z = ξ z + tv z for some t ∈ (0, r 0 ), and</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">• (ξ z + Γ(v z , θ)) ∩ B n (ξ z , r 0 ) ⊂ Ω.</formula><p>Here, Γ(v z , θ) denotes the open cone</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Γ(v z , θ) := {w ∈ C n : Re w, v z &gt; cos(θ/2) w }.</formula><p>The following result is classical in the case when Ω is bounded. But the choice of K = K(R) in Definition 2.3 requires care when Ω is unbounded, for which reason we provide a proof. Proof. Since ∂Ω is C 2 -smooth, for each p ∈ ∂Ω, we can find balls W p := B n (p, R p ), V p := B n (p, r p ) with 0 &lt; r p &lt; R p such that the following holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(a) For each z ∈ V p ∩ Ω, there exists unique ξ z ∈ ∂Ω such that ξ z − z = δ Ω (z) and ξ z ∈ W p , (b) If ξ 1 = ξ 2 ∈ ∂Ω ∩ B n (p, R p ), then {ξ 1 + tη ξ 1 : t ≥ 0} ∩ {ξ 2 + tη ξ 2 : t ≥ 0} ∩ B n (p, r p ) = ∅</formula><p>(where η ξ denotes the inward unit normal at ξ ∈ ∂Ω).</p><p>Fix R &gt; 0. If B n (0, R) ∩ Ω = ∅ or if B n (0, R) ⊂ Ω, then the two conditions in Definition 2.3 hold true vacuously (taking K = B n (0, R) in the latter case). Hence, fix R &gt; 0 such that ∂Ω ∩ B n (0, R) = ∅. Write S := ∂Ω ∩ B n (0, R). Let W := p∈S W p and V := p∈S V p . As S is compact, we can find a finite subcover {V 1 , • • • , V k } of {V p : p ∈ S} that covers S. Write V j := B n (p j , r j ) and W j := B n (p j , R j ). We can choose r &gt; 0 sufficiently small such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">p∈S B n (p, r) ⊂ k j=1 V j .</formula><p>(2.1)</p><p>Let K be the compact set, K ⊂ Ω, defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">K := B n (0, R) Ω \ p∈S B n (p, r/2) .</formula><p>Let r 0 := r/2. (Note that K and r 0 depend on R.)</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Fix z ∈ B n (0, R) ∩ (Ω \ K).</formula><p>Then, z ∈ p∈S B n (p, r/2). Hence, by (2.1), z ∈ k j=1 V j . Thus, there exists a unique point in ∂Ω, call it ξ z , such that δ Ω (z) = z − ξ z . Let η ξz denote the inward unit normal vector to ∂Ω at ξ z . Let z ′ := ξ z + (r/2)η ξz . If p is a point in S such that z ∈ B n (p, r/2), then it is immediate that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">• z − z ′ = |r/2 − δ Ω (z)|, whereby z ′ ∈ B n (p, r).</formula><p>• If, for some j = 1, . . . , k, V j contains z ′ (owing to (2.1)), then (with ξ z ′ having a meaning analogous to</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ξ z ) ξ z , ξ z ′ ∈ B n (p j , R j ) =: W j .</formula><p>Thus, by the property of the pair (V j , W j ) given by (b) above,</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ξ z = ξ z ′ ; thus δ Ω (z ′ ) = z ′ − ξ z = r/2. Therefore, B n (z ′ , r/2) ⊂ Ω.</formula><p>Now, clearly, z = ξ z + tη ξz , where t = z − ξ z &lt; r/2 = r 0 . Also, it is easy to see that there exists a uniform θ ∈ (0, π) such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">(ξ z + Γ(η ξz , θ)) ∩ B n (ξ z , r 0 ) ⊂ B n (z ′ , r 0 ) ∩ B n (ξ z , r 0 ) ⊂ Ω.</formula><p>Here, θ is given by the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">cos(θ/2) = Re η ξz , v / v = Re η ξz , v /r 0 , where v ∈ ∂B n (ξ z , r 0 ) ∩ ∂B n (z ′ , r 0 ).</formula><p>In the above expression, θ is independent of the choice of v as the inner product depends only on r 0 . For this reason, θ is also independent of z ∈ B n (0, R) ∩ (Ω \ K). This establishes the conditions given in Definition 2.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">3</ref>)], we are given that ∂Ω is visible as a part of the hypothesis of the result below. This results in a simpler proof than in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Since it is so vital to proving Theorem 1.7, we shall provide a proof of the following Proposition 2.5. Let Ω ⊂ C n be an unbounded Kobayashi hyperbolic domain and suppose ∂Ω is visible. Then, Ω is hyperbolically imbedded in</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">C n . Proof. Let p ∈ ∂Ω. Fix a pair of bounded C n -neighbourhoods U p , V p of p such that V p ⋐ U p . It suffices to show that K Ω V p ∩ Ω, Ω \ U p &gt; 0.</formula><p>We prove the above by contradiction. Assume that K Ω V p ∩Ω, Ω\U p = 0. Then, there exist a pair of sequences {z ν } ⊂ V p ∩ Ω and {w ν } ⊂ Ω \ U p such that K Ω (z ν , w ν ) → 0 as ν → ∞. As Ω is Kobayashi hyperbolic, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">Proposition 5.3]</ref>, for each ν there exists a (1, 1/ν)-almost-geodesic σ ν : [a ν , b ν ] → Ω joining z ν and w ν .</p><p>Claim. There exist a subsequence {(z</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">ν k , w ν k )} of {(z ν , w ν )} and a compact K ⊂ Ω such that σ ν k ([a ν k , b ν k ]) ∩ K = ∅ for all k. Proof of claim: Suppose {z ν : ν ∈ Z + } ⋐ Ω. Let K := {z ν : ν ∈ Z + }, which is contained in Ω and is compact, since V p is bounded. Clearly, σ ν ([a ν , b ν ]) ∩ K = ∅ for all ν.</formula><p>Now, suppose {z ν : ν ∈ Z + } Ω.

Recall that the exterior derivative d = (∂ + ∂) and d c := i(∂ − ∂). Let Ω ⊂ C n , n ≥ 2, be a bounded domain. Given two functions φ ∈ C(∂Ω; R) and h ∈ C(Ω; R), h ≥ 0, the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge-Ampère equation is the non-linear boundary-value problem that seeks a function u ∈ C(Ω; R) such that u| Ω is plurisubharmonic (which we shall denote as u ∈ psh(Ω) ∩ C(Ω) such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">(dd c u) n := dd c u ∧ • • • ∧ dd c u n factors = hV n ,<label>(3.1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">u| ∂Ω = φ,</formula><p>where V n is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">V n := (i/2) n (dz 1 ∧ dz 1 ) ∧ • • • ∧ (dz n ∧ dz n ).</formula><p>When u| Ω / ∈ C 2 (Ω; R), the left-hand side of (3.1) must be interpreted as a current of bidegree (n, n). That this makes sense when u ∈ psh(Ω) ∩ C(Ω) was established by Bedford-Taylor <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Our objective in considering the above Dirichlet problem is as follows. With Ω, h, and φ as above, any solution of this problem is a function u ∈ psh(Ω) ∩ C(Ω) that satisfies u| ∂Ω = φ; we would like to establish that there exist functions with the latter properties that belong to some Hölder class on Ω -assuming that ∂Ω is sufficiently "nice" and φ is sufficiently regular. The regularity theory for the complex Monge-Ampère equation provides us the means to the latter end. A regularity theorem of the type hinted at for Ω strongly pseudoconvex was established by Bedford-Taylor [1, Theorem 9.1]. Such theorems are much harder to deduce when Ω is weakly pseudoconvex.

As φ ∈ C 1, 1 (∂Ω), taking the values s = 1 and α = 1 in the conclusion of Result 3.1, we see that the Dirichlet problem stated in Result 3.1, with φ as above, has a unique solution of class C 2/m (Ω). Let us denote this solution by u φ . At this stage, exactly the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 4.2 with ω(r) := r 2/m , r ∈ [0, ∞),gives us a function U defined on Ω such that U | Ω is a smooth negative plurisubharmonic function that satisfies the conditions|U (z)| ≤ Cδ Ω (z) 2/m , (4.8) v, (H C U )(z)v ≥ v 2(4.9)(for some constant C &gt; 0) for every z ∈ Ω and v ∈ C n .

Let U p : D p → (−∞, 0] denote the function constructed in the proof of Theorem 1.1 that is plurisubharmonic on D p and satisfies the conditions (4.8) and (4.9) with m = m p .

Result 6.1 (Joseph-Kwack, [14, <ref type="bibr">Corollary 7]</ref>: paraphrased for Y , Z manifolds). Let Z be a complex manifold and Y be a complex submanifold of Z such that Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Z. Let X be a complex manifold, let k = dim C (X), and let A X be an analytic subvariety of dimension (k − 1) having at most normal-crossing singularities. Then, any holomorphic map f : X \ A → Y extends as a continuous map f : X → Z ∞ . Remark 6.2. A comment on certain terminology and definitions used in Joseph-Kwack <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> are in order.
