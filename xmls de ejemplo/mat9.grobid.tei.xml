<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The focus of this work is a class of weakly nonlinear dynamical systems; those that are linear time-invariant in the state equation with up to quadratic terms in the output equation. We refer to these systems as linear quadratic output (LQO) systems. Dynamical systems with quadratic output functions arise naturally whenever one's interests lie in observing quantities computed as the product of time or frequency domain components of the state <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Examples include applications where energy or power are considered; e.g., the internal energy functional of a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, or the objective cost function in optimal quadratic control problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Other examples include observables that capture the variance or deviation of the state coordinates from a point of reference; for instance, the root mean squared displacement of several spatial coordinates about a point of excitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, or the variance of a random variable in stochastic modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>The accurate modeling of complex physical phenomena often requires dynamical systems having a very large statespace dimension, e.g., on the order of 10 6 or even greater.</p><p>In this large-scale setting, direct calculations involving the full-order model (FOM) are prohibitively costly, and system approximation becomes desirable. Model order reduction (MOR) is the procedure by which one approximates a large-scale dynamical system with a comparatively loworder surrogate model. The resultant reduced-order model (ROM) should capture the significant input-to-output response characteristics of the original system in an appropriate sense, and can thus be used as a computationally efficient and faithful proxy for the FOM in applications of, e.g., prediction and simulation, or control.</p><p>In the purely linear setting (that is, both the internal dynamics and output equation depend only linearly on the state coordinates) there are a variety of model reduction techniques at one's disposal; we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> and to the collection of references therein for an overview of approximation methods for linear dynamical systems. In recent years, there has been an increased amount of study dedicated towards the model reduction of LQO systems; cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Some of these works tackle the LQO-MOR problem by rewriting the governing equations of a multi-input, single-output LQO system as a wholly linear multi-input, multi-output system that emulates the quadratic quantity of interest via multiple linear outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Any of the well-known model reduction techniques available for linear systems can then be applied to the intermediate model in order to determine suitable projection subspaces. However, a drawback of this approach is that it will produce an intermediate model with a very large number of outputs; this is undesirable in the design of reduced models since systems with large input/output dimensions tend to have slowly decaying Hankel singular values, and are thus more difficult to approximate <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Other works <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> devise approaches that leverage the quadratic output structure directly (that is, without any intermediate lifting or linearization) in order to determine suitable approximation subspaces for order reduction. Notably, the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> introduces a so-called quadratic output system Gramian based upon the nonlinear state-to-output kernels of an LQO system, and related H 2 system norm. These authors propose a balanced truncation model reduction algorithm that balances the linear reachability and quadratic output observability Gramians; the approach guarantees asymptotic stability and provides an a posteriori H 2 error bound. Extensions of this methodology to handle systems of differential-algebraic equations and frequency or time-limited model reduction were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, respectively. The works <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> all consider model reduction based on the rational interpolation of transfer functions in the frequency domain.</p><p>The focus of this paper is the H 2 optimal model reduction problem for LQO systems. Our interest in the H 2 model reduction problem is motivated by the fact that the H 2 system error provides an upper bound on the L âˆž output error <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 3.4]</ref>. So, if the design objective in order reduction is ensuring that the 'worst case' error in the approximate output is uniformly small over all inputs, then one should aim to make the H 2 system error as small as possible. Outside of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, use of the H 2 norm as a direct performance measure in LQO-MOR has not been considered in the current literature. For fully linear systems, the H 2 model reduction problem is well studied; cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and the references therein. H 2 model reduction has also been considered for other classes of weakly nonlinear dynamical systems; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. The work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposes an algorithm heuristically motivated by linear H 2 optimal model reduction, but without an explicit connection to the H 2 optimal model reduction of LQO systems. Even in the linear setting, finding a global minimizer of the H 2 error is a non-convex optimization problem. As a consequence, the most common practice in the H 2 landscape typically relies on the identification of ROMs that satisfy first-order necessary conditions (FONCs) for local H 2 optimality. The two most well-known optimality frameworks for H 2 model reduction of fully linear systems are derived from the interpolation-based FONCs of Meier and Leunberger <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, and the Gramian-based FONCs of Wilson <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. The major theoretical result of our work is the establishment of Gramian-based FONCs for the H 2 optimal model reduction of LQO systems. Namely, our significant contributions are:</p><p>1. Theorem 3.1, which derives gradients of the squared H 2 system error with respect to the system matrices of the LQO-ROM as parameters. The stationary points of these gradients directly yield Gramianbased FONCs for H 2 optimality, which are presented in Theorem 3.2. These results generalize the analogous Gramian-based FONCs for linear H 2 optimal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> to the LQO setting.</p><p>2. Also in Theorem 3.2, we show that a H 2 optimal LQO-ROM is necessarily defined by Petrov-Galerkin projection. The relevant projection matrices are obtainable as solutions to a pair of Sylvester equations. 2 Background and preliminaries</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Linear systems with quadratic outputs</head><p>Throughout this work, we consider multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) dynamical systems that are linear in the state equation with a quadratic output (QO) term. In its state-space formulation, such a system is described by the following equations S :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ áº‹(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), x(0) = 0, y(t) = Cx(t) :=y 1(t) + ï£® ï£¯ ï£¯ ï£° x(t) T M 1 x(t) . . . x(t) T M p x(t) ï£¹ ï£º ï£º ï£» :=y 2(t) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where A, M 1 , . . . , M p âˆˆ ÃŠ nÃ—n , B âˆˆ ÃŠ nÃ—m , and C âˆˆ ÃŠ pÃ—n . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> x : [0, âˆž) â†’ ÃŠ n contains the state coordinates; u : [0, âˆž) â†’ ÃŠ m and y : [0, âˆž) â†’ ÃŠ p are the inputs and outputs of the system, respectively. We assume henceforth that S is asymptotically stable, i.e., the eigenvalues of A denoted Î»(A) lie in the open left half of the complex plane, and without loss of generality that M k = M T k for all k = 1, . . . , p. We refer to a system of the form (1) as a linear quadratic output (LQO) system; we represent such a system using the notation (A, B, C, M 1 , . . . , M p ). The quadratic output term y 2 (t) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) can be re-written via a Kronecker product of the state</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y 2 (t) = M (x(t) âŠ— x(t)) , M = ï£® ï£¯ ï£° vec (M 1 ) T . . . vec (M p ) T ï£¹ ï£º ï£» âˆˆ ÃŠ pÃ—n 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where vec : ÃŠ nÃ—n â†’ ÃŠ n 2 denotes the vectorization operator. For compactness and ease of theoretical development, we switch freely between these representations as necessary. Depending on the application of interest, in (1) we allow for C = 0 pÃ—n , the p Ã— n zero matrix, in which case the output equation is purely quadratic. In this instance, we denote the LQO system in (1) by S 2 since only y 2 appears in the output y. On the other hand, if M k = 0 nÃ—n for all k = 1, . . . , p, the system (1) reduces to a standard linear time-invariant (LTI) system. We denote the system (1) by S 1 in this instance.</p><p>Remark 2.1. We illustrate why we may assume without loss of generality that M k is symmetric for each k = 1, . . . , p. For an arbitrary (not necessarily symmetric) matrix M k âˆˆ ÃŠ nÃ—n , the associated quadratic output in (1) can always be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x(t) T M k x(t) = x(t) T 1 2 M k + M T k x(t).</formula><p>In other words, M k can always be replaced by its symmetric part</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 2 M k + M T k .</formula><p>In practical applications, the state dimension n of the system in (1) may be large enough so that any repeated computation involving the full-order model is prohibitively expensive. Model order reduction (MOR) seeks to replace the original large-scale model with a lower dimensional reducedorder model (ROM) that can be used as a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate in numerical simulation, devising control laws, solving optimization tasks, etc. In this work, we consider the construction of reduced models that retain the LQO structure, i.e., S r :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ áº‹r (t) = A r x r (t) + B r u(t), y r (t) = C r x r (t) + ï£® ï£¯ ï£¯ ï£° x(t) T M 1,r x(t) . . . x(t) T M p,r x(t) ï£¹ ï£º ï£º ï£» ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the matrices A r , M 1,r , . . . , M p,r âˆˆ ÃŠ rÃ—r , B r âˆˆ ÃŠ rÃ—m , and C r âˆˆ ÃŠ pÃ—r are of a significantly reduced dimension 1 â‰¤ r â‰ª n; x r : [0, âˆž) â†’ ÃŠ r is the reduced state vector, and y r : [0, âˆž) â†’ ÃŠ p is the approximate output. We would like the surrogate model (3) to be a good approximation in the sense that it accurately recreates the input-to-output response of the original full-order system in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. In other words, the reduced output y r should be a faithful replication of y in the sense that yâˆ’y r is small in an appropriate norm â€¢ over a range of admissible inputs u.</p><p>The general framework we consider is that of model reduction using projection. Consider a linear quadratic output system as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. In projection-based model reduction, the problem resolves to choosing left and right reduction bases W r âˆˆ ÃŠ nÃ—r and V r âˆˆ ÃŠ nÃ—r so that: x â‰ˆ V r x r , the matrix W T r V r is nonsingular, and the Petrov-Galerkin condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">W r T (V r áº‹r (t) âˆ’ AV r x r (t) âˆ’ Bu(t)) = 0,</formula><p>is satisfied. The resulting order-r LQO reduced model of the form (3) is determined by the reduced order matrices</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A r = W T r V r âˆ’1 W T r AV r âˆˆ ÃŠ rÃ—r , B r = W T r V r âˆ’1 W T r B âˆˆ ÃŠ rÃ—m , C r = CV r âˆˆ ÃŠ pÃ—r ,</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">M k,r = V T r M k V r âˆˆ ÃŠ rÃ—r .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The approximation quality of the reduced model hinges upon the underlying projection subspaces span(W r ) and span(V r ), not the particular bases W r and V r used in (4). So, W r and V r are typically replaced by orthonormal matrices to avoid ill-conditioning and singularities in the reduced model. Following Remark 2.1, we also assume that M k,r is symmetric for each k going forward.</p></div>

So, if we wanted to project down the full-order matrices using the optimal choice of V r = X and W r = Z, this would require a priori knowledge of the optimal reduced-order quantities A r , B r , C r , and M k,r , which is of course unavailable.</p><p>Based on these observations, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that uses iterated projection with the solutions to the Sylvester equations (48) in Algorithm 1. This leads to a fixed point iteration where at every step, the equations (48) are solved to project the full-order LQO system to obtain a new reduced model. This procedure is repeated until some stopping criterion is satisfied. The idea of using fixed-point algorithms in H 2 optimal model reduction is not new; indeed, ours is inspired by a similar approach for linear H 2 optimal model reduction introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The computational procedure proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> is called the two-sided iteration algorithm, which performs iterative projection on the linear full-order model using the solutions to (37c) and (38b). Practical improvements that make TSIA more computationally efficient were considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Because of this, we call Algorithm 1 the linear quadratic output two-sided iteration algorithm (LQO-TSIA). </p><formula xml:id="formula_132">(0) r ) âŠ‚ âˆ’ , M k , M<label>(0)</label></formula><p>k,r symmetric for all k, and convergence tolerance Ç« &gt; 0.</p><p>1: while error &gt; Ç« do 2: Solve the Sylvester equations (48) for X, Z âˆˆ ÃŠ nÃ—r :</p><formula xml:id="formula_133">AX + XA (j) r T + BB (j) r T = 0, A T Z + ZA (j) r âˆ’ 2 p k=1 M k XM (j) k,r âˆ’ C T C (j) r = 0.</formula><p>3: Perform orthogonalization on the solution matrices:</p><p>V r = orth(X), W r = orth( Z).</p><p>4: Compute reduced-order matrices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_134">A (j+1) r = (W T r V r ) âˆ’1 W T r AV r , B (j+1) r = (W T r V r ) âˆ’1 W T r B, C (j+1) r = CV r , M (j+1) k,r = V T r M k V r , k = 1, . . . , p.</formula><p>5: end while.</p><p>Output: Order-r LQO-ROM specified by the reduced order matrices S r = (A r , B r , C r , M 1,r , . . . , M p,r ).</p><p>The main computational cost at each step lies in solving the Sylvester equations in Step 2 of Algorithm 1. However, because the solution matrices X, Z âˆˆ ÃŠ nÃ—r are tall and skinny, they can be obtained efficiently, e.g., by computing a Schur decomposition of the reduced matrix A r , and solving for their columns via shifted linear solves. Often, the full-order coefficient matrix A has some structured sparsity which can also be exploited <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sec. 3]</ref>. The iteration in Algorithm 1 repeats until either some preset number of steps is reached, or the algorithm converges within the inputted tolerance based on some pre-determined stopping criterion. As is the case with any optimization problem, there exist a variety of possible choices for measuring convergence. Because we are seeking to minimize the squared H 2 error J in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, for simplicity we use the change in the (relative) squared H 2 error between consecutive iterates to monitor convergence. By (40), the square of the relative error due to S (j) r at step j of the iteration is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_135">Î· (j) := S âˆ’ S (j) r 2 H2 S 2 H2 = S 2 H2 + S (j) r<label>2</label></formula><p>H2 + 2 tr(BZB</p><formula xml:id="formula_136">(j) r T ) S 2 H2 ,<label>(49)</label></formula><p>where Z âˆˆ ÃŠ nÃ—r satisfies (37d) for S (j) r . Then, Algorithm 1 is deemed to have converged if |Î· (j) âˆ’ Î· (jâˆ’1) |/Î· (1) â‰¤ Ç« for Ç« &gt; 0. The H 2 norm of the FOM in (49) can be pre-computed at the start of the iteration. Another natural option is to monitor changes in the gradients âˆ‡ Ar J , âˆ‡ Br J , âˆ‡ Cr J and âˆ‡ M k,r J of the error function J , and terminate when they are sufficiently small. The information required to compute these quantities is readily available from the iteration itself. However, for a relative metric that uses scaled gradients (as is usually done in practice) this would require computing the Hessian of J , which is not directly available from already computed quantities. So, we do not consider this convergence criterion further. Upon convergence of Algorithm 1, the optimality conditions in Theorem 3.2 are satisfied. As is the case for the linear TSIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> (and IRKA <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for the interpolatory formulation of the linear H 2 optimality framework) convergence of Algorithm 1 is not guaranteed in general since it is a fixed-point iteration. However, similar to TSIA and IRKA, in practice the algorithm performs well. We include a study of the convergence of Algorithm 1 in practice in Section 5.</p><p>For guaranteed convergence, one may consider developing a descent-based algorithm based on the explicit gradient formulae (42) we derived. We leave those computational considerations to a future work. Remark 4.1. For large-scale problems, computing the H 2 norm of the FOM entails the solution of the large-scale Lyapunov equation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, which may not be feasible in practice. The examples we consider in Section 5 have a modest state-space dimension, and so the H 2 norm of the full-order system S can be computed without issue. However, note that in the error formula (49), the only part that varies in each iteration is the 'tail', that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_137">Ï„ (j) := S (j) r 2 H2 + 2 tr(BZB (j) r T )<label>(50)</label></formula><p>Therefore, if computing the true (or an approximate) H 2 norm of the FOM is not feasible, one may monitor the tail Ï„ (j) and terminate the algorithm when the change in the tails fall below the inputted convergence tolerance. We investigate this choice in Section 5.</p><p>We conclude this section with a comment regarding the recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">Algorithm 1]</ref> where a two-sided iteration, similar to Algorithm 1, was proposed. The algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> was proposed without making explicit reference to H 2 optimality conditions; it was developed heuristically based on the corresponding two-sided iteration for linear systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. As a result, despite the structural similarities, the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> solves a different Sylvester equation to compute Z and thus, unlike Algorithm 1, the resulting ROM does not satisfy the H 2 optimality conditions in Theorem 3.2 upon convergence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Numerical Results</head><p>We test the effectiveness of the approach in Algorithm 1 on a numerical example. We compare our method to the structure-preserving balanced truncation algorithm for LQO systems from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We refer to this approach by LQO-BT. We consider the example of a 1D Advection-diffusion equation from [13, Section 4.1]. We briefly overview the relevant details of the example. The governing equations are</p><formula xml:id="formula_138">âˆ‚ âˆ‚t v(t, x) âˆ’ Î± âˆ‚ 2 âˆ‚x 2 v(t, x) + Î² âˆ‚ âˆ‚x v(t, x) = 0, v(t, 0) = u 0 (t), Î± âˆ‚ âˆ‚x v(t, 1) = u 1 (t), v(0, x) = 0,<label>(51)</label></formula><p>for x âˆˆ (0, 1) and t âˆˆ (0, T ) and inputs u 0 , u 1 âˆˆ L 2 (0, T ); the diffusion and advection coefficients are Î± &gt; 0 and Î² â‰¥ 0, respectively. The quantity of interest that we consider is</p><formula xml:id="formula_139">1 2 1 0 |v(t, x) âˆ’ 1| 2 dx,<label>(52)</label></formula><p>Such an observable may arise from, e.g., the objective function in a quadratic optimal control problem. Discretizing the equations in (51) using n + 1 equidistant spatial points yields an order-n state-space model of the form (1) with m = 2 inputs and p = 1 output y. Let x(t) âˆˆ ÃŠ n denote the spatial discretization of v(t, x), h := 1/n, and 1 âˆˆ ÃŠ n the vector consisting of all ones. Then, the discretization pro-vides an approximation to the quadratic cost function (52)</p><formula xml:id="formula_140">h 2 x(t) âˆ’ 1 2 2 = âˆ’h1 T x(t) =y1(t) + h 2 x(t) T x(t) =y2(t) + h 2 1 2 2 = y(t) + h 2 1 2 2 .</formula><p>To fit (1), we consider the single output of the discretized system to be given by y(t) = cx(t) + x(t) T Mx(t) where c := âˆ’h1 T âˆˆ ÃŠ 1Ã—n and M := h 2 I n âˆˆ ÃŠ nÃ—n is the n Ã— n identity matrix. The approximation to the cost is recovered from the output y(t)</p><formula xml:id="formula_141">via h 2 x(t) âˆ’ 1 2 2 = y(t) + h 2 1 2 2 .</formula><p>We perform a discretization of (51) using n = 300 spatial grid points to obtain an LQO system in state-space form (1); the advection and diffusion parameters are selected as Î± = 0.01 and Î² = 1. Reduced-order models of order r = 30 are computed using the LQO-TSIA and LQO-BT approaches. The LQO-TSIA is run with an overtly strict tolerance of Ç« = 10 âˆ’14 to investigate the two convergence criteria discussed in Section 4 (in practice one would choose a lower stopping criterion). The change in the relative squared H 2 error functional at each step (49) is used to determine convergence. As an initialization, A </p><p>r âˆˆ ÃŠ rÃ—r is the r Ã— r identity matrix. We test the performance of the two reduced-order models in reproducing the output of the full-order system using two choices for the input u 1 ; in either case, we enforce the Neumann boundary condition of u 0 (t) = 0. We first simulate the full and reduced-order dynamics influenced by the sinusoidal input u 1 (t) = 0.5 cos(Ï€t) + 1 and then by the exponentially damped quadratic input u 1 (t) = t 2 e âˆ’t/5 . To capture the full spread of the output dynamics in each experiment, the first simulation occurs over T = 10 seconds, and the second over T = 30 seconds. We plot the output response of the full and reduced-order systems due to the sinusoidal and exponentially damped inputs and the associated relative pointwise error in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>, respectively. As evidenced by the error plots, both LQO-TSIA and LQO-BT are successful in replicating the full-order output for both inputs, while the approximation due to LQO-TSIA performs slightly better on average. (After we numerically investigate different convergence criteria of LQO-TSIA next, we will provide a more detailed comparison to LQO-BT with respect to the H 2 error.)</p><p>To numerically investigate the behavior of the two different convergence criteria for LQO-TSIA discussed in Section 4, we track the following two quantities during the iteration for the previously discussed r = 30 case: (1) The relative change in the (relative) squared H 2 error, |Î· (j) âˆ’ Î· (jâˆ’1) |/|Î· (1) | for Î· (j) in (49), and (2) The relative change in the variable tails of the error, |Ï„ (j) âˆ’ Ï„ (jâˆ’1) |/|Ï„ (1) | for Ï„ (j)  in (50) mentioned in Remark 4.1. The magnitude of these quantities throughout the iteration is plotted in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The relative changes in the H 2 errors |Î· (j) âˆ’ Î· (jâˆ’1) |/Î· (1)  between consecutive iterates level off around the iterates j = 75 to j = 80. At this point, a local minima of the squared H 2 error has been found, and the algorithm converges shortly after. Evidently, |Ï„ (j) âˆ’ Ï„ (jâˆ’1) |/|Ï„ (1) tracks |Î· (j) âˆ’ Î· (jâˆ’1) |/Î· (1) very well until convergence. At the point at which the H 2 error begins to stagnate, the change in tails continues to decay. So, this convergence criterion may cause Algorithm 1 to continue to iterate past the point at which relative the H 2 error has stagnated. However, these two measures start to stagnate around a relative measure of 10 âˆ’10 , a tolerance much tighter than one would usually employ in practice. Therefore, even though we conclude that monitoring changes in the relative squared H 2 error (49) to be a more reliable convergence metric, monitoring changes in the tails according to (50) prove to be a robust alternative if computing the H 2 norm of S is intractable.</p><p>Finally, to better compare the performance of LQO-TSIA and LQO-BT, we compute a hierarchy of reduced models for orders r = 2, 4, . . . , 30 using both LQO-TSIA and LQO- iteration count j |Î· (j) âˆ’ Î· (jâˆ’1) |/Î· (1)  |Ï„ (j) âˆ’ Ï„ (jâˆ’1) |/|Ï„ (1) | Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Convergence of the LQO-TSIA algorithm for r = 30. The relative changes in Î· (j) and Ï„ (j) according to (49) and (50) are measured throughout the iteration.</p><p>BT. The same initialization and convergence criterion from before are used for LQO-TSIA. For each order, the squared relative H 2 error due to the order-r LQO-TSIA and LQO-BT reduced models are computed using formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. The results are plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>. As the order-r increases, the relative H 2 error due to the LQO-TSIA and LQO-BT ROMs decrease as well; the LQO-TSIA models exhibit a slightly smaller error for all orders of reduction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this work, we have presented a novel H 2 optimality framework for the model reduction of LQO dynamical systems. The novel contributions are the computation of gradients of the squared H 2 error for such systems in Theorem 3.1, and the generalization the well-known Gramian-based H 2 optimality framework for linear dynamical systems to the model reduction of LQO systems in Theorem 3.2. Finally, a linear quadratic-output two-sided iteration algorithm, LQO-TSIA, is proposed in Algorithm 1 for the efficient H 2 model reduction of LQO systems. We illustrate the effectiveness of LQO-TSIA on a numerical example resulting from an optimal control problem. In the future, we will consider alternative H 2 optimality frameworks for LQO system using the concept on rational function interpolation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>M</head><label></label><figDesc>e P e M e = 0, A e P e + P e A T e + B e B T e = 0.</figDesc></figure>

These characterizations are central to the theoretical results developed in Section 3, where we present the main theoretical contributions of this work. These are the derivation of gradients of the squared H 2 system error and resulting Gramian-based FONCs for H 2 optimal LQO-MOR. Section 4 presents LQO-TSIA, an iterative computational algorithm for LQO-MOR based on the previously established H 2 optimality framework. The algorithm requires the solutions to a pair of Sylvester equations. To validate the proposed approach, in Section 5 we test our method on an example where a quadratic output naturally occurs from the discretization of a quadratic cost function. Section 6 concludes the work and looks toward future research endeavors.</figDesc><table /><note>3. Based on this theoretical optimality framework, wepropose an iteratively corrected algorithm for H 2 optimal LQO-MOR in Algorithm 1; we call this the linear quadratic output two-sided iteration algorithm (LQO-TSIA). The algorithm produces (upon convergence) LQO-ROMs that satisfy the Gramian-based FONCs from Theorem 3.2.</note></figure>
