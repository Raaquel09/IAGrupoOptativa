<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Quantum computers powered by quantum algorithms promise to offer problem-solving abilities that will far exceed the most powerful supercomputers of today. These quantum algorithms rely on efficient arithmetic circuits to harness their full potential. While the quantum computing space continues to bustle with diverse research activities, optimizing quantum circuits remains a fundamental necessity. Quantum adders stand out as one of the key circuits in any quantum computing system. For instance, Shor's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which can factorize large integers exponentially faster than a classical computer, relies on efficient quantum addition.</p><p>While adder circuits have been frequently explored in classical computing, they remain relatively less-chartered in the quantum computing paradigm. Arithmetic circuits have been extensively explored in classical computing. Interestingly, the Sklansky Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is widely applied for its minimal depth among all the other parallel prefix structures. However, implementing this structure in the quantum world presents significant challenges, primarily due to qubit non-copyability.</p><p>Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

This paper proposes a novel quantum adder based on the Sklansky Tree, which is verified as the optimal depth structure among all the quantum adders. Throughout this research, we faced a series of challenges. Specifically, the inability to copy qubits presented a barrier to the direct application of the prefix tree adders in the quantum world. To address this issue, we developed a quantum repeat gate that helps to efficiently incorporate the different Prefix Tree structures such as Sklansky <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> into the quantum world under specific constraints. The proposed repeat gate not only contributes to the establishment of an optimal-depth quantum adder but also effectively addresses the problems arising from qubit non-copyability in other specific quantum circuits.</p><p>Our primary contribution is the development of the optimal-depth quantum adder that achieves an remarkable Toffoli-Depth of log 𝑛 + O (1) for 𝑛 bit-sized additions. Obviously, it marks an important improvement over all the previous quantum carry-lookahead adders based on the Brent-Kung tree, which required a minimum of 2 log 𝑛 + O (1) Toffoli-Depth. By conducting a thorough assessment involving Toffoli-Depth, Qubit Count, and Toffoli-Count, this paper offers significant insights into the strengths and constraints of the quantum optimal-depth adder, enhancing the continuous development of quantum computing, which parallels the development of classical adder analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In brief, the main contributions include:</p><p>• Thoroughly investigate the prefix tree and explore computation forms using different propagation and generation techniques.</p><p>• Propose innovative designs for optimal Toffoli-Depth adders, optimal Toffoli-Depth Ling adder and optimal Toffoli-Depth modular adder, achieving the peak performance in quantum addition circuits.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the relevant previous research. In Section 3, we introduce and compare the Sklansky Tree and other parallel prefix structures. Section 4 presents the overall design of the proposed optimal Toffoli-Depth quantum adder, Ling expansion and modular adder expansion. Additionally, Section 5 offers a detailed performance analysis, including a comparison with dominant quantum adder designs. We conclude the paper and discuss future research directions in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>We provide a comprehensive overview of the related literature in this section. In the quantum world, reducing the Toffoli gate is a prominent trend <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>[18] due to its time-intensive property. Among all the different types of quantum adders, Carry-Lookahead Adders (CLAs) are specially designed to achieve reduced depth. In 2004, Draper et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed a logarithmic-depth quantum carry-lookahead adder, reducing Toffoli-Depth from 𝑂 (𝑛) to 𝑂 (log 𝑛), resulting in notable efficiency improvements. Subsequently, there was an obvious increase in the development of quantum CLAs.</p><p>For example, Takahashi et al. further optimized Draper's work and designed some important quantum CLAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> compared all the quantum CLAs and found Brent-Kung <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to be the top choice for implementing quantum adders.</p><p>However, it is interesting to note that, while majority of the quantum CLAs are based on the Brent-Kung structure, the Kogge-Stone <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and Slansky <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> architectures continue to have the lowest depth among all the parallel prefix structures in theory. For example, compared to Brent-Kung's 2 log 𝑛 depth, the Kogge-Stone and Slansky structures achieve n-bit addition with only half the depth. However, research on the quantum prefix tree structure is currently limited. This is primarily due to the nature of the prefix tree structures which involve extensive bit-sharing operations.</p><p>In classical computing, multiple operations that share the same input bit are possible simultaneously. In the quantum domain, due to the non-copyability of qubits, operations sharing the same input must be executed in separate time slots. As a result, previous works have favored the use of the Brent-Kung tree in quantum computing, considering it a more convenient and cost-effective approach. Nonetheless, we have proposed a novel addition framework to solve this qubit-sharing challenge within specific constraints. Following a thorough comparison, we have found that the Sklansky Tree emerges as the optimal structure among all the quantum prefix tree adders.</p><p>In this paper, we propose an innovative quantum optimal-depth adder based on the Sklansky tree. Through systematic comparison with other existing designs, our adder demonstrates a Toffoli-Depth of log(𝑛) + O (1), which significantly outperforms the Toffoli-Depth of previous Brent-Kung-based adders. Consequently, our design has the potential to become a noteworthy candidate for constructing large-scale quantum circuits, mirroring an advancement similar to classical adder circuit design <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DESIGN CHOICES FOR DEPTH REDUCTION</head><p>In this section, we elaborate on the choices to be made with the primary objective of reducing Toffoli-Depth. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, in this study, we explored a total of 160 design options. In Sections 3.1 and 3.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Choice of Prefix Tree</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, the classical Sklansky tree and Kogge-Stone tree stand out as the most efficient parallel prefix structures in terms of logical depth compared to other similar structures, such as the Brent-Kung tree and the Han-Carlson tree. Among state-of-the-art logarithmic-depth quantum adders, the common approach is to use the Brent-Kung tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. However, it is well known in the classical adder that the Kogge-Stone and Slansky prefix trees can achieve a significantly lower logical depth, i.e., log 𝑛, reducing depth of the Brent-Kung tree by half. Given this substantial difference in logical depth, it is surprising that these prefix trees were not studied earlier. One possible reason for the same is the prefix tree incurs an overhead due to copy operation, which is inherently prevented in quantum domain due to no-cloning theorem. However, this limitation can be bypassed through introduction of ancilla qubits with initialization states as |1⟩ or |0⟩ and proper application of CNOT gate as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>Among the five prominent quantum prefix tree structures, Quantum Slansky (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(b)) stands out as particularly advantageous. While it exhibits the lowest logical depth, Quantum Slansky also features significantly fewer CNOT operations compared to Quantum Koggle Stone, which has an equivalent logical depth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Choice of Propagate and Generate Computation</head><p>The efficiency of quantum carry-lookahead adder depends on the choice of propagate and Generate strategy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Quantum Prefix Tree Adder</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, we construct the Quantum prefix tree adder by combining the steps 1 to 4.</p><p>• Step 1. The initial propagation 𝑝 𝑖 and generation 𝑔 𝑖 are calculated using a single ancilla qubit and one Toffoli gate. Consequently, Toffoli-Depth is 1, Toffoli-Count is 𝑛, and Qubit-Count is (3𝑛 + 1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">|a i ⟩ • • |a i ⟩ |b i ⟩ • |p i ⟩ |0⟩ |g i ⟩</formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑎 𝑖 ⊕ 𝑏 𝑖<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">𝑔 𝑖 = 𝑎 𝑖 • 𝑏 𝑖<label>(7)</label></formula><p>• Step 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In the previous section, we proposed the general framework and specific quantum implementations of several quantum prefix tree adders. In this section, we will provide all the details of the results and discussions. Our investigation focuses on the quantum out-of-place adder due to its direct reflection of the prefix tree's influence and its lower Toffoli-Depth compared to the quantum In-place adder. Conversely, while the In-place adder follows a similar workflow, it typically involves more intricate supplementary steps, resulting in a deeper Toffoli-Depth.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Extension 1: Ling-based Optimal Toffoli-Depth adder</head><p>Inspired by the innovative quantum Ling adder proposed by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, we introduce a novel quantum Ling structure based on the prefix tree adders proposed in this paper. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>  ( This design significantly reduces the Toffoli-Depth of the quantum Ling adder by half. However, this improvement is accompanied by an acceptable increase in Toffoli-Count and Qubit-Count. Specifically, the Toffoli-Depth of our Lingbased Kogge-Stone adder is 2 log 𝑛 2 + 8, reflecting innovative adaptations in generation and propagation computations, thereby significantly optimizing the depth of the initial quantum Ling adder <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This proposed extension structure demonstrates commendable performance in enhancing the efficiency of Ling-based quantum adders, thereby confirming the flexibility and portability of the adders proposed in our paper. However, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>, we also find that replacing traditional propagation and generation with Ling base is not beneficial for the prefix tree adders we propose. This is because the Ling structure introduces OR logic, requiring two Toffoli gates at each calculation node for propagation and generation. Overall, using Ling base almost doubles the Toffoli-Depth of the prefix tree adders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Extension 2: Optimal Toffoli-depth Modular Adder</head><p>In this extension, we utilized the VBE modular addition framework mentioned in the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which incorporates the quantum prefix tree adders proposed in this paper, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">|N ⟩ / n × × |N ⟩ |a⟩ / n QPA × QPS 0 QPA 0 × QPS QPA |a⟩ |b⟩ / n |S 0:n ⟩ |b h ⟩ / 1 • • |S n+1 ⟩ |t⟩ / 1 • • |t⟩</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>. Quantum VBE Modular Addition Framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Besides, the 'Set 0' gate in the framework can be implemented using several CNOTs.</p><p>Our quantum modular addition framework primarily contains two important parts: the quantum prefix tree adder and the quantum prefix tree subtractor, with the latter being an altered version of the former. As illustrated in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13(a</ref> The implementation of the quantum subtractor is based on certain modifications to the quantum adder, as indicated by Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Specifically, we begin to take the bit-wise complement of 𝑎, then add 𝑏 to obtain the result 𝑎 ′ + 𝑏.</p><p>Finally, we take the two's complement of the qubits of 𝑎 and the output qubits. Remarkably, this process can be easily accomplished using a series of quantum NOT gates. Hence, the cost of the quantum prefix tree subtractor is very close to the cost of the corresponding adder.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">𝐴 − 𝐵 = (𝐴 ′ + 𝐵) ′<label>(10)</label></formula><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>, we demonstrate the performance of our designed modular adders compared to other existing quantum modular adders. Our designs exhibits superior Toffoli-Depth, particularly the Quantum Sklansky with Strategy 2 design achieving an optimal Toffoli-Depth of 5 log 𝑛 + 5. However, this achievement comes at the cost of a higher Qubit-Count and Toffoli-Count.</p><p>Above all, our design achieves optimal depth in the quantum world, maintaining an exceptionally low Toffoli-Depth.</p><p>This accomplishment provides a crucial foundation for efficient arithmetic in quantum computing, unlocking new possibilities for high-performance quantum algorithms and enhancing the overall scalability and practicality of quantum computing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>In conclusion, this paper has presented a novel architecture for enhancing the efficiency of quantum adders. By integrating the different prefix tree into the quantum domain, we have achieved a groundbreaking optimal Toffoli-Depth quantum adder, which marks a parallel to the development of classical adder analysis. Furthermore, our work includes a significant quantum Ling expansion, which substantially improves the quantum Ling adder's performance by using  In future, several research directions hold substantial promise. For instance, one of these directions is exploring the optimal adder structure on the real quantum computers. Moreover, Quantum Error Correction (QEC) also plays a crucial role in improving the adder's fault tolerance and reliability.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
