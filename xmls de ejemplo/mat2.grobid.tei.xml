<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>An irreducible holomorphic symplectic (ihs) manifold is a simply connected, compact, complex, Kähler manifold X carrying a non-degenerate holomorphic symplectic form σ X which spans H 0 (X, Ω 2 X ). An automorphism of an ihs manifold is called symplectic if it acts trivially on the symplectic form, non-symplectic otherwise. A cyclic group G ⊂ Aut(X) is called non-symplectic if it is generated by a non-symplectic automorphism.</p><p>Cubic hypersurfaces in P 5 admit a Hodge decomposition of K3 type, i.e. H 4 (Y, C) = H 3,1 (Y ) ⊕ H 2,2 (Y ) ⊕ H 1,3 (Y ) and h 3,1 (Y ) = 1, hence there is a notion of symplectic and non-symplectic automorphisms. Namely, an automorphism of a cubic fourfold Y is symplectic if the induced action on H 4 (Y, Z) acts trivially on H 3,1 (Y ), non-symplectic otherwise.</p><p>Giovenzana-Grossi-Onorati-Veniani <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> prove that any symplectic automorphism of finite order of an ihs manifold of O'Grady's 10-dimensional deformation type is trivial.</p><p>In this paper we classify non-symplectic automorphisms of prime order of an ihs manifold X of OG10 type. If X can be realized as a compactification of the intermediate jacobian fibration of the hyperplane sections of a cubic fourfold, referring to the model due to Laza-Saccà-Voisin <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56]</ref>, we give a lattice-theoretic criterion to determine when such an automorphism is induced by an automorphism of the cubic fourfold. To this purpose, we study the induced action on H 4 (Y, Z) by a non-symplectic automorphism of prime order of a smooth cubic fourfold Y . Starting from these results we exhibit the algebraic and the transcendental lattice of a general cubic fourfold that admits a non-symplectic automorphism of prime order. Moreover, we give a geometric set of generators of the algebraic lattice in terms of planes or cubic scrolls. As a consequence, we discuss the rationality conjecture for cubic fourfolds with a non-symplectic automorphism of prime order.</p><p>The classification of the algebraic and the transcendental lattices of a cubic fourfold with a non-symplectic involution, and the discussion of the rationality conjecture for such a cubic, is the content of a recent paper by Marquand <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>The classification of automorphisms of ihs manifolds of OG10 type is an extension of a result by Brandhorst-Cattaneo <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that provide lattice-theoretic constraints of non-symplectic automorphisms of odd prime order of an ihs manifold in terms of isometries of unimodular lattices.</p><p>One of the advantages in studying induced automorphisms is to control the fixed locus. Automorphisms of ihs manifolds with empty fixed locus are needed to construct Enriques manifolds, the higher dimensional analogue of Enriques surfaces, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref> for more details. The authors together with Luca Giovenzana and Franco Giovenzana in an upcoming paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> use the results about induced automorphisms to investigate the existence of Enriques manifolds as free quotient of ihs manifolds of OG10 type.</p><p>1.1. Automorphisms of ihs manifolds and cubic fourfolds. Automorphisms of ihs manifolds can be classified studying the induced action on the second integral cohomology H 2 (X, Z), which carries a lattice structure provided by the Beauville-Bogomolov-Fujiki quadratic form. In particular, if X is an ihs manifold of OG10 type we know by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> that H 2 (X, Z) is isometric to the abstract lattice L := U ⊕3 ⊕ E 8 (−1) ⊕2 ⊕ A 2 (−1). A marking is an isometry η : H 2 (X, Z) → L and, whenever we fix a marked pair (X, η) of OG10 type, the representation map <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> η</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">* : Aut(X) → O(L), f → η • (f −1 ) * • η −1</formula><p>is injective by a result of Mongardi-Wandel <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. For this reason, we study automorphisms in terms of their induced action in cohomology. More precisely, if an isometry ϕ ∈ O(L) verifies the assumptions of Hodge-theoretic Torelli theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 1.3]</ref>, then there exists an automorphism g ∈ Aut(X) such that η * (g) = ϕ. If (X, η) is a marked pair of OG10 type, an isometry ϕ ∈ O(L) is non-symplectic if the action on the Hodge structure of L ⊗C (induced via the marking) is non-symplectic. A cyclic group G ⊂ O(L) is called non-symplectic if G is generated by a non-symplectic isometry.</p><p>Similarly if Y is a cubic fourfold, the integral cohomology H 4 (Y, Z) with the intersection form, is an odd unimodular lattice isometric to <ref type="bibr">[</ref> p (Y, Z) the even lattice of algebraic primitive cycles. A marking is an isometry γ : H 4 p (Y, Z) → F. Let (Y, γ) be a marked pair, an isometry ϕ ∈ O(F) is non-symplectic if the action on the Hodge structure of F ⊗C (induced via the marking) is nonsymplectic. Automorphisms of Y are identified with Hodge isometries of H 4 p (Y, Z) by the Hodgetheoretic Torelli theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>, and then similar techniques to the ones used for ihs manifolds can be applied.</p><p>We recall the known results about automorphisms of other deformations types of ihs manifolds.

A lattice L is a a free Z-module of finite rank with an integral bilinear form</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(−, −) : L × L → Z</formula><p>wich is non-degenerate.

A lattice is hyperbolic if it is indefinite and l + = 1. A lattice L is called even if x 2 := (x, x) ∈ 2Z for any x ∈ L.

Let L be an even lattice, define</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">δ(L) := 0 if q AL (x) ∈ Z/2Z for any x ∈ A L 1 otherwise . Definition 2.2. We call short root a vector v ∈ L such that v 2 = 2 and div(v, L) = 1. We call long root a vector v ∈ L such that v 2 = 6 and div(v, L) = 3.</formula><p>A morphism of lattices L → M is a linear map that preserves the bilinear forms, an injective morphism of lattices is called an embedding. An embedding L ֒→ M is called primitive if its cokernel is free. If the embedding L ֒→ M has finite index, then we say that M is an overlattice of L. Recall that by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr">Proposition 1.4.1]</ref> there is a bijective correspondence between overlattices of L and isotropic subgroups of A L . Moreover, if L ֒→ M is a primitive embedding, then M is an overlattice of L ⊕ L ⊥ and hence the primitive embeddings L ֒→ M are determined by an anti-isometry between a subgroup of A L and a subgroup of A M , this subgroup is called the gluing subgroup, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr">Proposition 1.15.1]</ref>. The genus of a lattice L is given by its signature sign(L) and discriminant quadratic form q AL , or equivalently <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr">Corollary 1.9.4</ref>] by the isometry class of U ⊕L where U denotes the unique even unimodular lattice of rank 2. Isometric lattices have the same genus, but lattices with the same genus might not be isometric. Typically, indefinite lattices tent to have a unique isometry class for a fixed genus and definite lattices tent to have more isometry classes for a fixed genus. If we consider a primitive embedding L ֒→ M up to isometries of M , this determines uniquely the genus of the orthogonal complement L ⊥M but it might not determine its isometry class, see e.g. Example 2.3.</p></div>

Proof. Using Lemma 4.5 we can determine the rank of F G and F G , since the dimensions of M G are available at <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 6.1]</ref>. Consider the composition of the two natural primitive embeddings</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">F G ֒→ F ֒→ H 4 (Y, Z) and notice that F G ∼ = H 4 (Y, Z) G . Since H 4 (Y, Z</formula><p>) is unimodular, we can apply [9, Theorem 1.1] to determine the list of the possible lengths of F G . Note that since F G is indefinite and 3-elementary, to know the length is equivalent to determine its isometry class. To determine the length of F G we can consider F G = A p (Y ), and by Lemma 4.3 determines the list of possible lengths of F G . We know by Torelli theorem for cubic fourfolds Theorem 2.9 that A p (Y ) does not contain short roots and long roots. We exclude isometry classes of lattices that contain short roots via the sphere packing argument used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> or by computer algebra (we refer to OSCAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>) for the remaining cases. By Lemma 4.4, to check the existence of long roots in F G is equivalent to determine the gluing isometry between A F G and A ηY . This is equivalent to determine the isometry class of A(Y ). To do that, we compute via computer algebra, the possible isometry classes for A(Y ) and discard the ones containing a vector of square one. Then, for the remaining cases we compute the orthogonal complement of all the possible vectors of square three (candidates for η Y ) and check if they are isometric to A p (Y ). This happens only in one case, as we expect by Theorem 2.13, this gives A(Y ) and the coordinates of η Y in A(Y ). The length of T (Y ) equals the one of A(Y ) because they are orthogonal complements in a unimodular lattice and this allows us to know the isometry class of T (Y ).

Let Y be a general cubic fourfold with automorphism of order three φ 1 3 or φ 5 3 , then Y does not have an associated K3 surface.</p><p>Proof. Suppose the cubic has an associate K3 surface, then there exists a primitive embedding of T(Y )(−1) in the K3 lattice, which is given by U ⊕3 ⊕ E 8 (−1) ⊕2 . It is easy to see that this is not possible for the lattices T(Y ) in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> corresponding to φ 1 3 and φ 5 3 . Remark 4.8. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, there is also a notion of twisted K3 surface associated to a cubic fourfold. We observe that if Y is a general cubic fourfold with the automorphism φ 5  3 , then Y has an associated twisted K3 surface. Namely Y ∈ C 12 and 12 satisfies condition (ii) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">Proposition 6.23]</ref>. A general cubic fourfold with automorphisms φ 1 3 or φ 5 3 is conjecturally irrational. Moreover, a general cubic fourfold with the automorphism φ 1  3 does not lie on any Hassett divisor. Lemma 4.9. Let Y be a general cubic fourfold with an automorphism of order three of type φ 5  3 , then Y ∈ C d for d ≡ 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. The divisor C 8 parametrizes cubic fourfolds containing a plane. In particular, a general cubic fourfold with automorphism φ 5  3 does not contain a plane since Y ∈ C 8 but such a cubic belongs to C 12 , which is the closure of the locus of cubic fourfolds containing a rational cubic scroll. Proposition 4.10. Let Y be the general cubic fourfold with automorphism φ 5  3 , then the Fano variety of lines F (Y ) contains 54 classes of rational curves. Proof. By the numerical description of the extremal rays of the Mori cone for hyperkähler manifolds of K3 [2] type in [41, Proposition 2.12], we know that divisors of square −2 and divisors of square −10 and divisibility 2 in H 2 (F (Y ), Z) correspond to extremal rays of the Mori cone, in particular they are classes of rational curves on F (Y ). By <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, there is an isomorphism of integral Hodge structures H 4 p (Y, Z)(−1) ∼ = H 2 p (F (Y ), Z). We know that there are no short roots in A p (Y ), then the only possibility is to have vectors in H 1,1 (F (Y ), Z) of square −10 and divisibility 2 in H 2 (F (Y ), Z). Recall that the polarization H of F (Y ) has square 6 and divisibility 2 in H 2 (F (Y ), Z). The lattice</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">A p (Y )(−1) ∼ = H 1,1 (F (Y ), Z) is 3-elementary, hence vectors v ∈ H 1,1 (F (Y ), Z) of divisibility 2 in H 2 (F (Y ), Z) are of the form v = H + 2a with a ∈ H 1,1</formula><p>p (F (Y ), Z). To get v 2 = −10 we need 4a 2 = −16 and then a 2 = −4. By the classification in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>  Proof. Every class of a rational curve on F (Y ) corresponds to the class of a rational ruled surface on the cubic fourfold Y . Since, by construction, every such a surface is contained in an hyperplane section of Y , then the cubic surface is a rational cubic scroll. By Proposition 4.10, we have 54 rational cubic scrolls and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr">Example 7.16</ref>] on a fixed cubic fourfold these scrolls are parametrized by two distinct copies of P 2 . Given a cubic scroll [T i ], there is a residual scroll (the dual cubic scroll) [T ∨ i ] which is obtained by intersecting a linear hyperplane and a quadratic hypersurface containing [T i ], as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> (each one of them correspond to a distinct (−10) class, as we found). One can easily check (using computer algebra <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>) that A p (Y ) contains exactly 54 vectors of square 4 that generate the entire lattice, moreover the classes</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">α i := [T i ] − η Y and α ∨ i := [T ∨ i ] − η Y have square 4.</formula></div>

A general cubic fourfold Y with the non-symplectic automorphism of order three φ 7  3 has a primitive algebraic lattice A p (Y ) computed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. We prove that the cubic has an associated K3 surface and it is rational. Moreover we show that the algebraic lattice of such a cubic fourfold is generated by classes of planes. Lemma 4.12. Let Y be a general cubic fourfold with automorphism φ 7  3 , then Y has an associated K3 surface and Y is rational.</p><p>Proof. Consider a general cubic fourfold Y with automorphism φ 7  3 , then it is easy to see that the lattice T(Y )(−1) in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> corresponding to φ 7  3 admits a primitive embedding in a K3 lattice, hence Y has an associated K3 surface. Moreover if Y admits an automorphism φ 7  3 then Y ∈ C 14 , as K 14 = η Y , m 1 + m 2 gives a labeling if (η Y , m 1 , . . . , m 8 ) is a basis for the matrix of A(Y ) in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. It is well known that any cubic fourfold on C 14 is rational <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Proposition 4.13. Let Y be a general cubic fourfold with automorphism φ 7  3 .

If a plane is contained in Y it has to be invariant for the action of φ 7  3 on P 5 . If a plane is invariant for the action of φ 7  3 it has equation [e:f ] to its factors, and denote by f 1 , f 2 , f 3 the fibers of these three projections. The set S coincides with the intersection of the following three divisors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">F {a,b,c,d,e,f } := {ax 0 = bx 1 , cx 2 = dx 3 , ex 4 = f x 5 }.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_50">2f 1 + f 2 , f 1 + 2f 3 , 2f 2 + f 3 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>then S is a finite set of degree (2f</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">1 + f 2 )(f 1 + 2f 3 )(2f 2 + f 3 ) = 9.</formula><p>This means that the intersection of these three divisors gives exactly none points in</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">P 1 [a:b] × P 1 [c:d] × P 1 [e:f ]</formula><p>, that correspond to the nine planes that we denote by F 1 , . . . , F 9 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Cubic fourfolds with automorphism φ 2</head><p>3 . A cubic fourfold Y with the non-symplectic automorphism of order three φ 2 3 has a primitive algebraic lattice A p (Y ) computed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. In this section we explore the geometry of a cubic fourfold with such an action making a couple of complementary remarks, referring to <ref type="bibr">[30, §2]</ref>. In particular, we prove that a cubic fourfold Y with such an action contains eightyone invariant planes that are related to the existence of three Eckardt points on Y . Lemma 4.14. Let Y be a general cubic fourfold with automorphism φ 2  3 , then Y has an associated K3 surface and Y is rational.</p><p>Proof. Same proof as Lemma 4.12, where the labeling is given by K 14 = η Y , −m 6 + m 7 where (η Y , m 1 , . . . , m 12 ) is a basis for the matrix of A(Y ) in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p><p>Here we recall the definition of an Eckardt point for a cubic fourfold given in [30, Definition 1.5], where we only consider smooth cubic fourfolds. We prove that a cubic fourfold with the automorphism φ 2 3 contains three Eckardt points. Proposition 4.16. Let Y be a general cubic fourfold with an order three non-symplectic automorphism φ 2  3 . Then Y contains exactly eightyone (invariant) planes, associated to three fixed Eckardt points P 1 , P 2 , P 3 ∈ Y .</p><p>Proof. Recall that a general cubic fourfold Y with an action of automorphism φ 2 3 is described as L 3 (x 0 , . . . , x 3 ) + M 3 (x 4 , x 5 ) = 0, where L 3 and M 3 are two homogeneous polynomials of degree 3 in x 0 , . . . , x 3 and x 4 , x 5 respectively. If P = [0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : p : q] is a zero of the polynomial M 3 (x 4 , x 5 ), then we can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">M 3 (x 4 , x 5 ) = (qx 4 − px 5 )M 2 (x 4 , x 5 ).</formula><p>Note that the equation of the tangent plane T P Y is {qx 4 − px 5 = 0} since ∂F ∂x4 |P = q and ∂F ∂x5 |P = p. Then the intersection T P Y ∩ Y is a cone with vertex P over the invariant cubic surface S = Y ∩ {x 4 = x 5 = 0}, hence P is an Eckardt point. There are three such Eckardt points P 1 , P 2 , P 3 corresponding to the points M 3 = 0. By the argument above each one of them gives an invariant Eckardt point P i = [0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : a i : b i ] ∈ Y for i = 1, 2, 3. The cone over the invariant surface with vertex any of the Eckardt points is still invariant and contained in Y . The cubic surface S contains exactly 27 lines, then any Eckardt point determines 27 invariant planes passing through the lines of the surface. If F ⊂ Y is a plane, then by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>, its cohomology class is such that [F ] 2 = 3 and [F ] • η Y = 1, moreover any class with these numerical properties is represented by a unique plane. Using computer algebra, one can check that there are exactly eightyone such classes in A(Y ). Proof. The automorphism of order three is given by φ 2  3 and, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> for any Eckardt point there is an associated involution given by a hyperplane reflection. From the matrix description of the automorphisms, choosing an appropriate set of coordinates, the reflections generate the dihedral group and commute with the automorphism φ 2 3 . Proposition 4.18. Let Y be a general cubic fourfold with automorphism φ 2 3 . In the notation of the proof of Proposition 4.16, consider the 6 disjoint lines on the cubic surface S contained in Y , and consider the classes of the planes [F ij ] for i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and for j ∈ {1, . . . , 6} that are the unique planes passing through the Eckardt point P i and one of the disjoint lines in S. Then the algebraic lattice A(Y ) has a basis given by the classes of the following planes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">• [F 1,j ] for all j ∈ {1, . . . , 6} • [F 2,k ] for k ∈ {1, . . . , 5} • [F 1,0</formula><p>] and [F 2,0 ] where F 1,0 and F 2,0 are classes of the the cones of the pullback of a general line via S = Bl 6 P 2 → P 2 with vertex, respectively, the Eckardt points P 1 and P 2 .</p><p>Proof. The intersection numbers of the classes corresponding to planes in the cone with vertex an Eckardt point are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr">Lemma 2.4]</ref>, the cases where the planes pass thought different Eckardt points can be easily deduced. The classes [F 1,0 ] and [F 2,0 ] correspond to a union of planes P 0 + P ′ 0 + P ′′ 0 and Q 0 + Q ′ 0 + Q ′′ 0 respectively, where P 0 shares a line with P ′ 0 and P ′′ 0 and the intersection P ′ 0 ∩ P ′′ 0 is a point (and the same behaviour for Q 0 , Q ′ 0 , Q ′′ 0 ) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>). The rank</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">13 sublattice of A(Y ) generated by {[F 1,j ], [F 2,k ], [F 1,0 ], [F 2,</formula><p>0 ]} j,k coincides with A(Y ) since the intersection matrix has the same determinant as the one of A(Y ) in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p><p>Remark 4.19. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">Proposition 3.3]</ref> for a hypersurface of degree d = 3 in P 5 the Eckardt points of the hypersurface have to be at most d = 3 points on a line l not contained in Y . This configuration is actually verified for a general cubic fourfold with an order three non-symplectic automorphism φ 2  3 . Note that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 1.8]</ref> and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> the authors study the minimal algebraic lattice that a cubic fourfold Y needs to have in order to admit an Eckardt point, and they find that a cubic fourfold Y with a non-symplectic involution φ 1  2 has an Eckardt point. In this situation they prove that A p (Y ) ∼ = E 6 (2) and the cubic fourfold has no associated K3 surface by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 1.2</ref>]. In the case of a cubic fourfold with an automorphism of order three φ 2 3 the cubic fourfold has more algebraic classes, it admits also the involution φ 1 2 as we showed in Corollary 4.17, but it is rational and has an associated K3 surface, as we prove in Lemma 4.14.</p><p>Remark 4.20. Note that by lattice-theoretic considerations we can detect that a cubic fourfold with automorphism φ 2 3 contains an Eckardt point. Namely let Y be a general cubic fourfold with an order three non-symplectic automorphism φ 2 3 , then it is easy to see that there exists a primitive embedding E 6 (2) ֒→ A p (Y ), and this is enough to conclude that Y contains an Eckardt point by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr">Proposition 2.8]</ref>.</p></div>

We collect this information in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. We study the induced action on the second integral cohomology of birational transformations of LSV manifolds induced by automorphisms of cubic fourfolds.

An automorphism of the cubic fourfold Y induces a birational transformation of the twisted LSV manifold J t (Y ).

Let Y be a cubic fourfold, φ ∈ Aut(Y ) is symplectic if and only if φ ∈ Bir(J(Y )) and φ t ∈ Bir(J t (Y )) are symplectic. Proposition 5.8. Let Y be a general cubic fourfold with a non-symplectic automorphism φ ∈ Aut(Y ) of finite order and let φ ∈ Bir(J(Y )) be the induced birational transformation on the LSV manifold J(Y ). Then there is an isometry</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">(H 4 p (Y, Z)) φ (−1) ∼ = (U ⊥ Y ) φ ⊂ H 2 (J(Y ), Z) φ .</formula><p>The same statement holds for J t (Y ), replacing U Y with U t Y ∼ = U(3) and φ with φ t .</p><p>Proof. We prove the statement for the untwisted case, the twisted case is analogous. By [56, Section 3.1] every birational transformation φ ∈ Bir(J(Y )) of a LSV manifold which is induced by an automorphism φ ∈ Aut(Y ) of the cubic fourfold Y fixes the two generators of U Y . We consider the isometry φ restricted on U ⊥ Y , which is still a Hodge isometry since the two generators in U Y are of (1, 1) type.

Here q : U Y → Y is the inclusion of linear sections and [Z] * (x) = π 1 * (π * 2 x.Z) where Z ∈ CH 2 (J(Y ) × P 5 U Y ) Q is the closure of a distinguished cycle Z U ∈ CH 2 (J U (Y )× P 5 U U ) Q , and π 1 , π 2 are the respective projections.

Proposition 5.9. Let X be a manifold of OG10 type with a marking H 2 (X, Z) ∼ = L and let f ∈ Bir(X) be a general non-symplectic birational transformation of prime order. Then f is induced by an automorphism of a cubic fourfold if and only if it acts trivially on the discriminant group A L , and one of the following holds: i) there is a primitive embedding U ֒→ NS(X) such that U ⊥ NS(X) ∩W P ex = ∅, ii) there is a primitive embedding U(3) ֒→ NS(X), such that U(3) ⊥ NS(X) ∩ W P ex = ∅.</p><p>Proof. By generality assumption we have L f = NS(X). If f is natural the statement follows from Proposition 5.8 and Theorem 2.13. Viceversa, assume f ∈ Bir(X) is a non-symplectic birational transformation acting trivially on A L and such that i) holds. Consider the lattice N := U ⊥ L(−1) . Since U ⊥ NS(X) ∩W P ex = ∅ and prime exceptional divisors of an OG10 type manifold correspond to short and long roots up to the sign, by Theorem 2.9 there exits a smooth cubic fourfold Y such that H 4 p (Y, Z) ∼ = N is a Hodge isometry. The restriction of the isometry f to N extends to an isometry of H 4 (Y, Z) that fixes the class η Y = H 4 p (Y, Z) ⊥ ⊂ H 4 (Y, Z) if and only if f acts trivially on the discriminant group A L(−1) ∼ = A N , as in our assumption. We conclude by Proposition 5.8 and Theorem 2.13. The same proof holds true assuming ii). Lemma 5.10. Let Y be a general cubic fourfold with a non-symplectic automorphism φ ∈ Aut(Y ) of finite order.

In this subsection we relate isometries of the lattice L with isometries of the lattice Λ, depending on the image of the group G ⊂ O(L) via the map O(L) → O(A L ). In this section we fix the (unique) primitive embedding L ֒→ Λ, whose orthogonal complement is L ⊥ ∼ = A 2 . If ϕ ∈ O(L) is an isometry such that ϕ = id ∈ O(A L ) then it extends to and element φ ∈ O(Λ) acting trivially on L ⊥ ⊂ Λ. If ϕ ∈ O(L) is an isometry such that ϕ = − id ∈ O(A L ), then ϕ extends to an isometry φ ∈ O(Λ) that acts on the rank 2 lattice L ⊥ ⊂ Λ permuting the generators. Proof. Let a, b be generators of A 2 (−1) ⊂ L and consider the generator [ a−b 3</figDesc></figure>

The action of G on the unimodular lattice H 4 (Y, Z) is trivial on η Y ∼ =<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> hence the action is trivial on the discriminant group A ηY ∼ = A F . As a consequence, we have an isometry H 4 (Y, Z) G ∼ = F G and then F G is p-elementary by Lemma 2.6. The possible discriminant groups of F G are determined by<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref> Proposition 1.5.1]. The statement about the signatures is standard. Lemma 4.4. Let S be a lattice such that S ֒→ F is a primitive embedding with embedding subgroup A F ∼ = Z/3Z. Denote by N the smallest primitive lattice containing S ⊕ η Y ⊂ H 4 (Y, Z). Then there exists v ∈ S with v 2 = 6 and divisibility div(v, F) = 3 if and only if there exists w ∈ N such that w 2 = 1.</figDesc></figure>

The equation of a cubic fourfold Y with an action of φ7  3 is given in Theorem 4.1 and it is straightforward to see thatY ∩ F {a,b,c,d,e,f } coincides with {x {2,1,0} (a, b, c, d, e, f ) + x 2 4 x 0 P {1,0,2} (a, b, c, d, e, f ) + x 2 2 x 4 P {0,2,1} (a, b, c, d, e, f ) = 0},where P {i,j,k} are polynomials of multi-degrees (i, j, k) in P 1 [a:b] ×P 1 [c:d] ×P 1 [e:f ] .
