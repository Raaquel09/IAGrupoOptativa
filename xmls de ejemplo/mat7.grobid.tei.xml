<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We study the property of global-local mixing for full-branched expanding maps of either the half-line or the interval, with one indifferent fixed point. Global-local mixing expresses the decorrelation of global vs local observables w.r.t. to an infinite measure µ. Global observables are essentially bounded functions admitting an infinite-volume average, i.e., a limit for the average of the function over bigger and bigger intervals; local observables are integrable functions (both notions are relative to µ). Of course, the definition of global observable depends on the exact definition of infinite-volume average. The first choice for it would be to consider averages over the entire space minus a neighborhood of the indifferent fixed point (a.k.a. the "point at infinity"), in the limit where such neighborhood vanishes. This is the choice that was made in previous papers on the subject. The classes of systems for which global-local mixing was proved, with this natural choice of global observables, are ample but not really general. In this paper we consider uniformly global observables, i.e., L ∞ functions whose averages over any interval V converges to a limit, uniformly as µ(V ) → ∞. Uniformly global observables form quite an extensive subclass of all global observables. We prove global-local mixing in the sense of uniformly global observables, for two truly general classes of expanding maps with one indifferent fixed point, respectively on R + 0 and on (0, 1]. The technical core of the proofs is rather different from previous work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the context of infinite ergodic theory, the notion of global-local mixing involves two types of observable functions: local observables and global observables.</p><p>If (M, A , µ, T ) is a dynamical system where (M, A , µ) is a σ-finite, infinite measure space and T : M −→ M is surjective, bi-measurable, and non-singular w.r.t. µ, a local observable is a function f ∈ L<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> (M, A , µ).</p><p>The notion of global observable requires a definition of infinite-volume average, which is given as follows. Let V be an exhaustive family, that is, a collection of sets V ∈ A , with µ(V ) &lt; ∞, containing at least an increasing sequence (V k ) k∈N such that k V k = M. The infinite-volume limit V ∋ V ↗ M is defined to be the uniform limit for V ∈ V , as µ(V ) → ∞. In particular, a function F : M −→ R is said to have infinite-volume average µ V (F ), w.r.t. V and µ, if the following limit µ V (F ) := lim</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V ∋V ↗M 1 µ(V ) V F dµ (1.1)</formula><p>exists, which means that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">lim r→∞ sup V ∈V µ(V )≥r 1 µ(V ) V F dµ − µ V (F ) = 0. (1.2)</formula><p>A global observable is an essentially bounded function admitting an infinite-volume average, that is, an element of</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">G V (M, A , µ) := {F ∈ L ∞ (M, A , µ) | ∃µ V (F )} . (1.3)</formula><p>This space will be henceforth referred to as the (maximal) space of global observables, relative to V and µ. 1</p><p>Convention. From now on we will abbreviate all notation such as G V (M, A , µ), L ∞ (M, A , µ), etc. to G V , L ∞ , etc. Should certain dependences need to be specified we might write G V (µ), L ∞ (µ), etc.</p><p>The definitions of infinite-volume mixing <ref type="bibr">[L1, L3]</ref> concern the decorrelation properties of global and local observables. Given subspaces G ⊆ G V , L ⊆ L 1 , we say that T (endowed with the measure µ) is global-local mixing w.r.t. V , G and L if</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∀F ∈ G, ∀g ∈ L, lim n→∞ µ((F • T n )g) = µ V (F ) µ(g),</formula><p>(1.4)</p><p>with the standard notation µ(g) := M g dµ. The reasons one may want/need to restrict the class of global and local observables, respectively, to strict subspaces of G V and L 1 has to do with the truth and feasibility of the sought result. In general, if possible, one would like to show that T is global-local mixing w.r.t. V , G V and L 1 . We refer to this property as full global-local mixing, relative to V . An equivalent way to introduce definition (1.4) is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∀F ∈ G, ∀g ∈ L, g ≥ 0, µ(g) = 1, lim n→∞ T n * µ g (F ) = µ V (F ), (1.5)</formula><p>where µ g is the measure determined by dµg dµ = g and T * is the push-forward operator for T acting on measures. This formulation makes it apparent that global-local mixing defines a sort of "convergence to equilibrium" for a class of probability measures, where the infinite-volume average plays the role of the limit measure and the global observables play the role of test functions. This seems reasonable in all cases where the dynamics tends to spread trajectories all over an infinite-measure space, and so the evolution of probability measures cannot have a limit in any standard measure-theoretic way <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[L1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">L3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">L5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">BGL1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">BGL2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">BL,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">DN,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">GHR1]</ref>.</p><p>Global observables are also used in the context of global-global mixing, another notion of 'infinite-volume mixing' that was devised in <ref type="bibr">[L1]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[L2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">L5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">DN,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">TZ1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">TZ2]</ref>), and for the question of pointwise convergence of Birkhoff averages in infinite measure <ref type="bibr">[LM, DLN, BS]</ref>. In infinite ergodic theory, there exist other definitions related to mixing <ref type="bibr">[S, DS]</ref>, including the so-called Hopf-Krickeberg mixing (a short list of recent papers in this area include <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[MT,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">P,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">PT,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">GHR2]</ref>, see also references therein).</p><p>Expanding maps with a sufficiently flat indifferent fixed point are paradigmatic examples of dynamical systems with an infinite measure. For the reasons set forth earlier, they are generally expected to be global-local mixing (though not global-global mixing, as their "mixing region" is essentially of finite measure in an infinite-measure space <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[BGL1]</ref>).</p><p>In this paper we consider full-branched expanding maps defined either on (0, 1] or on R + 0 , with a single indifferent fixed point respectively in 0 or at ∞ (the latter case meaning that T (x) ∼ x, as x → +∞). Their infinite-volume mixing properties were studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[BGL1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">BL]</ref> (and partly in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[BGL2]</ref>). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[BGL1]</ref> global-local mixing was proved for a class of maps of the interval with an increasing and a decreasing branch (plus certain generalizations) and for a class of maps of the half-line with finitely or infinitely many increasing branches, which preserve the Lebesgue measure (plus certain generalizations). In <ref type="bibr">[BL]</ref> global-local mixing was proved for two classes of maps, of the interval and the half-line respectively, with finitely or infinitely many increasing branches: in the case of the interval, the most relevant assumption was a certain growth condition on the branches of the map; in the case of the half-line, the analogue of such condition was still assumed, though it was much more natural, and no assumption was made on the preservation of the Lebesgue measure. The maps studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[BGL1]</ref> include the Fairy map and the ones studied in <ref type="bibr">[BL]</ref> include the classical Pomeau-Manneville maps and the Liverani-Saussol-Vaienti maps.</p><p>For all the above maps, the authors proved full global-local mixing relative to the exhaustive families</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">V min := {[a, 1] | 0 &lt; a &lt; 1} , for the case M = (0, 1]; {[0, a] | a &gt; 0} ,</formula><p>for the case M = R + 0 .</p><p>(1.6)</p><p>In both cases, V min is essentially the smallest exhaustive family one can take, if it is to include an increasing sequence of finite-measure sets covering M (whence the notation). Therefore G V min is essentially the largest class of global observables within the framework presented earlier. Since L 1 is also the largest class of local observables within the theory, full global-local mixing w.r.t. V min is the most general result of its type.</p><p>That said, the state of the art is not quite satisfactory, as the classes of maps investigated so far are not as general as one expects global-local mixing to hold for. Here we prove global-local mixing for two general classes of maps, on (0, 1] and R + 0 , respectively, admitting increasing and decreasing full branches, though we slightly restrict the class of global observables. We consider in fact uniformly global observables, that is, global observables relative to the exhaustive families</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">V unif := {[a, b] | 0 &lt; a &lt; b ≤ 1} , for the case M = (0, 1]; {[a, b] | 0 ≤ a &lt; b} , for the case M = R + 0 .</formula><p>(1.7)</p><p>In view of definitions (1.1)-(1.3), this means that averaging one of these observables over any interval with large enough measure will result in a uniformly good approximation of the infinite-volume average. Understandably, G V unif is a strict subspace of G V min . For example, in the case M = R + 0 and µ = m, the Lebesgue measure, it is easy to check that lim</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r→+∞ 1 r r 0 cos √ x dx = 0, (1.8)</formula><p>while, for all r &gt; 0, sup / inf</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">a∈R + 0 1 r a+r a cos √ x dx = ±1, (1.9) implying that F (x) := cos √ x belongs to G V min but not to G V unif .</formula><p>Uniformly global observables have been previously studied, together with other classes of global observables, in more general contexts than the present one, cf. <ref type="bibr">[DN, DLN]</ref>.</p><p>For the classes of maps we consider, cf. Sections 2.2 and 2.3, we prove full globallocal mixing for uniformly global observables. The technique of the proofs is different from what was used so far: the main tools in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[BGL1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">BGL2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">BL]</ref> were the so-called persistently monotonic local observables, that is, monotonic L 1 functions which maintain their monotonicity when acted upon by the dynamics (namely, by the corresponding transfer operator). Persistently monotonic local observables form an invariant convex cone in L 1 . Here we also use dynamics-invariant cones of local observables, but of a different nature, related to the logarithmic derivative of the observables.</p><p>Here is an outline of the paper: In Section 2 we first introduce the class of uniformly global observables, for both the case of the half-line and of the unit interval, discussing the dependence of their infinite-volume average on the measure defined on the system. Then we define our maps and state the main results, most notably the full global-local mixing for uniformly global observables, w.r.t. relevant equivalence classes of measures. Section 3 contains the core proofs.</p><p>Acknowledgments. This research was partially supported by the PRIN Grant 2017S35EHN of the Ministry of University and Research (MUR), Italy.

Proof. Let us first show that µ is a restriction of ν, meaning that G unif (µ) ⊆ G unif (ν) and, for all F ∈ G unif (µ), ν(F ) = µ(F ). Fix F ∈ G unif (µ). By Proposition 2.1, as V ↗ M, V F dν = µ(V ) 1 µ(V ) V F dν dµ dµ ∼ µ(V )c µ(F ), (2.6)</formula><p>where ∼ denotes exact asymptotics.

So one applies the first part of this proof with U M , ν| U M , µ| U M in place of M, µ, ν, respectively.

Obviously, by means of a suitable conjugation Ψ : (0, 1] −→ R + 0 (say a smooth, decreasing function with a non-integrable singularity in 0), one can always view a dynamical system (R + 0 , B R + 0 , µ, T ) as the system ((0, 1],</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">B (0,1] , µ o , T o ), with µ o := Ψ −1 * µ and T o := ψ −1 • T • ψ,</formula><p>whence a theorem for the former system can be rewritten as a theorem for the latter system, and viceversa.
